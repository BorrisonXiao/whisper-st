is it
it's like this
ah now now well for getting the visa done it's quite troublesome well
er they they said there in Shanghai it seems that er now it happens to be
the time when students go to school so
there are lot of people apply for visa particularly
oh lining up yes
so
so
oh
that doesn't matter he's already different from that student
it is in charge based on categories
classify into different categories to manage but the problem is there's a ratio
probably for example it
this one
Shanghai around for example it has to turn down a certain percentage of the total
so if there are many students leaving then
then the probability of being turning down would be high naturally
oh my god
right
um
where is you your wife from
oh my god
from Shanghai
ah also from Shanghai
that's right
oh
that
her parents can't come
her parents ah it's really
her parents are already in here actually
oh
but her parents are timid
you know they
her parents are in that
staying with her older sister
yes after living in her sister place for a while
even if dare not have the family registration go clandestine
la
yes
and then go back go back then failed to get the visa
oh
well your your your dad
yes
isn't coming
he hasn't come yet now he
you just apply for your mom alone
yes first I have to make my mom come over first
your mom
how old is she
ah
how old is your mom
sixty
ah that's easy
ah
surely it's easy to have the visa issued
for the sixties it'd be easy
it's surely easy
yes yes yes that's for sure people over sixty years old all get visa easily none of them is rejected
really
ah
eh I I I a while ago ago just now well
one of our people here
a friend's well parents they two went together to apply for the visa
and then
were just rejected I don't know whether he's over sixty years old or not
he he anyway he is
his well
reason is simply that

Wow, terrible. [laugh]
[laugh] Ah, uh, I
When will you go there?
We will go there on August 13th.
Oh, August 13th.
We will go there from here on [unknown] August 13th, then,
I have rented a house now, it's more than five hundred dollars.
[mouthnoise] More than five hundred and thirty.
Oh, what kind of house do you live, two bedroom?
Is it
one bedroom.
How come it is so expensive then?
Consumption level there is high.
They can do nothing about it, that's it.
Oh
That's it, the one bedroom [unknown] [unknown] you live in now is more than four hundred dollars, right?
Right.
% Um, three hundred and four.
Three hundred and four, one bedroom.
Right.
Right. [laugh]
Wow, it is so cheap, it's really cheap. [laugh]
[laugh] But there is not much money, the total money we have is not much.
Oh, does the house of [unknown] [unknown] yours include everything and it is three hundred and four, or,
Electric charge, something like gas fee, paid by yourself
% Um, right, it includes everything, because its electric charge, because it's like the school type.
Ah.
The house of school includes everything.
Ah, ah, ah, ah.
Ah, [unknown] right, your place is much better.
Right, yes, it's pretty cheap.
What work did Huang Pujiang also do during summer vacation?
Huang Pujiang has done a section during summer vacation, he had no work.
Then this section, also does section
Is he a TA?
Right.
Oh, then there were financial aid provided during vacations, were n't there?
Vacation,
He just does n't have that section, [laugh] the previous section
Oh, he does n't have that section?
Right.
Ah, then you
Then, it's equivalent to no money for one and a half month.
Then no money for one and a half month.
That would [unknown] not be cared, alas would not be cared, what are you doing now?
I'm reading English now.
Reading English, are you preparing for an exam?

Yes.
What will you do after that?
Then I will prepare to go to school.

What plan does [unknown] [unknown] Huang Pujiang have now, studying for a PhD or?
He wants to study for a master â€™s degree now. [laugh]
Yes.
Then going to look for a job?
Right, looking for a job, right.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Anyway, it seems that he prefers to go to California, to look for a job in California.
That's good, we will be neighbors again after you coming here, [laugh] he probably will go to our place, both are possible.
[laugh] It's really uncertain. [laugh]
Oh, oh, oh.
What is Zhou Ningning doing now?
That
She is right here, she will talk to you later, uh, [unknown] I want to ask you, in other words, why do you now, in other words, how long will he [unknown]
Ah.
When will you plan to graduate?
Oh, he plans to, he plans to graduate in March, probably.
Next March?
Right.
In ninety six.
Oh, that's pretty soon.
Yes.
However, the job he learned, the lessons he learned, uh, was something related to computer, which is easy for him to find a job.
Yes.
It's very easy to find a job, because it's what he said in summer , he just wants to look for, uh, some job like summer.
Ah, ah.
Then, other people request him according to the conditions when he's looking for a job.
Yes.
Then, if he really wants to look for a job, if he graduates immediately, then it's very easy to find a job, but if he does intern, it's difficult to process.
Oh, oh, oh.
Other people request the time to be longer, or request other things uh.
Right, right, right, right.
So he wants to graduate immediately. [laugh]
Immediately graduate and look for a job, however, their incomes are and normally pretty good. You are likely to study in California then.
Yes.
Ah? Right, it's possible, it's unknown now. [laugh]
Studying,
Ah, how do you feel, how do you feel living here in America?
I'm feeling ok.
Are you feeling ok?
Yes. [laugh]
You are feeling pretty good, are n't you?
Yes.

Forty square meters, ah, ah, ah,
Right.

That's no problem, if we can go there, [laugh]
% Er, it may be more convenient for living,
% Er
Do you have any news of Old Yang?
Now there seems no news.
Did n't Old Yang some time ago,
He, uh
Did n't he contact,
Then there was no news, just no news of him.
Yes.
Then, he said that he would probably contact again next year.
Contact again next year?
Right.
Wow, Old Yang really has suffered for a long time.
[breath] His luck was very
Uh, [unknown] I also helped him, but I could do nothing about this.
His luck was very bad, I think.
Right, right, right, I think so, his luck was too bad, he did n't know what happened.
Yes, there was nothing to do about it , [breath] yes.
Because I think he is not good enough, you took the exam again, the kids from Tsinghua get very high scores now.
He did n't get high scores, and he also.
[unknown] did n't take the oral exam, etc., which means, he has no advantage.
Right, now it is, this is a threat [mouthnoise] , ha, oh, you said Gu Lizheng will go abroad this year, wo n't he?
Ah, Gu Lizheng will go abroad, oh, I do n't know which school he will go? I do n't know.
Right, have you heard of Wang Xiaohui who is our alumni.
Wang Xiaohui will definitely go abroad too, because when I came, he [unknown] seems to have three schools again .
Right, right, he will come to my school.
Oh, he will go to your school, and you will go?
Right .
Right, [laugh] I will go, he can go to my position.

More than two thousand two hundred.

Anyway, it's not too bad.
It's pretty high. [laugh]
Ah.
[laugh] Oh, I.
Now I have nothing to do.
Um?

You have n't contacted? Oh, that's ok, your marks are so high, and it will be easy for you to contact them after you get there.
Ah.
[unknown] then it always take half a year or one year, anyway, [laugh] I will have nothing to do [unknown] again.
% er [laugh]
[laugh] anyway, [unknown] I %pw.
Staying at home is also pretty.
did you hear clearly
listen carefully
UH-HUH
it doesn't matter
let's talk about it ourselves
that um
there are many choices what kind of choices are there
ah the thing is today I saw my
first house
UH-HUH
it's empty
ah
it has two bedrooms and one one bathroom
ah
well and then that KITCHEN is relatively small that bathroom is also relatively small
and then which is UNFURNISHED UTILITY I have to paid by myself
ah
and then the STARTING STARTING PRICE is five hundreds and sixty-nine
so how much does it cost plus the UTILITY
plus UTILITY maybe
UTILITY usually a month maybe two people add together would be twenty to thirty similar with yours
oh you have to pay them all
including water electricity gas and so on right
yes
oh that can't be only two twenty or thirty
and then
in winter your gas might be I don't know whether you use
YES
use gas or other fuel if using gas in winter sometimes it might be
more than fifty sometimes even over one hundred
really
um
and then
oh I don't know at your place at your place in winter
that house is quite big
ah
eight hundreds and fifty SQUARE FEET
and then and then that it
me and then Shi Jun even took me to there specially just took
found a big
that is to say
drove a long distance to find that INFORMATION of MUTTER MUTTER STATION
then just
but if you still have to take MUTTER every month it would be fifty more
oh
in this case a month maybe which is almost I mean if it's
er maybe it would be between three hundreds and fifty to four hundreds
ah
this is this is one CHOICE this place is really closer
ah
it's also the only single one I can hope for among all the calls I had made today
ah
then what
um and then yes
well later yesterday when we were in the A AND PEACE didn't we see a AMRY WOODS
ah
and then well he said now there is only there is only that ONE BEDROOM it's the APARTMENT well I told you about that EFFICIENCY yesterday
ah
it it's having that KITCHEN inside the BEDROOM you know this
and then there's a BATHROOM
this is one CHOICE
that is to say
this one is three hundred yuans for a month I heard it's that person
whether they're all included
does the three hundred yuan include all bills
um doesn't include everything I think
is it
and then this is one CHOICE
and then and then this CHOICE I still haven't checked it because today the call was answered by that BABYSITTER in the morning
ah
and then and then well but later Wu Ding
that Wu Ding of our Chinese students and scholars union had called me
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
he said
um he has now rented one just in the AMRY WOODS he rents
um
um
well then there's one Chinese who takes the small
ah
that person um just is to move out at the end of this August
ah
he said if I I was interested um I could just move in
ah
then that I for the day after tomorrow um Shi Jun will take me to have a look at that house
ah
he said um just he said because they'd already taken the big room I so they would still take the big one and I took the small one
ah
just that I can just pay less for the house rent
ah
for that I think that probably I can pay ten
twenty or thirty bucks less hmm probably
his that is five hundred five hundred bucks for the whole house it's five hundred bucks
ah
then what
that
you haven't talked about the rent have you
just
I told him that I said that that's just um pay half the house rent huh
he said nope he said that because they lived there um that they'd taken the bigger room he said that the house house house rent could be lower he said if I took the small one
ah
ah
he said that the house rent could be lower
um
then huh but his has only one BATHROOM just it's not that convenient his is that kind of APARTMENT with that um double deck
um
just
TWO BEDROOMs are upstairs and below there probably is the LIVING ROOM
um
but
um but just because I haven't been to that house so just no idea I I think probably just it's very likely can be FURNISHED hmm
um
and for that KITCHEN or alike probably need to SHARE with him
um
just that um fridge or alike probably
just can SHARE with him well then that he he might have one MICROWAVE and that TOASTER so no need for me to buy any
um
maybe I can also use his which means I may still have to go there
then you can have a look
ask his wife
ah this is one sort of better CHOICE
um
there's another CHOICE
it's good it's wonderful
only I really can't go to school
that CHOICE is also offered by a Chinese I I gave a call to a man of Chinese students and scholars union at the end he
helped me made a POST on the AMRY website already got reply at night
um
there's a man he's living in the place of an an over seventy years old American old lady
um
about his house one side it's two-storied another side is single-storied the old lady lives in the single-storied one by herself
ah
ah
he and an Iranian live in that two-storied one
ah
each person has one BEDROOM and one BATHROOM
ah
ah
and then that old lady she has fridge
ah
and then LOCAL PHONE it's C FREE
ah
then what
er and then has that WASHER DRYER
ah
which means you can just you know in the house
um I know I know
and then including whatever gas water electricity all UTILITY
and then that rent is three hundreds for a month
wow it's too far isn't it
yes it's FOUR MILES away from AMRY
ah
that might be a little far huh
yes it's a bit far away actually this place is the best I think
why
ah
why
and then this phone it means this kind of local rate call costs
LOCAL call won't cost much
LOCAL call of course won't be much money but think about it all UTILITIES are included
if you want to get the cheap one then you might be going to where Wu Jing is in
oh come on
you may go and have a look
I I think it's not definitely
how it could be
because think about it once you use that UTILITIES
what UTILITY did Wu Jing tell you
Wu Ding he this rent we talked about it's the money for the house you understand
yeah that is to say UTILITY won't be
because his he that UTILITY it also has to pay by himself
yeah as long as you SHARE it the UTILITY won't be much
pay separately
yes
because PAY the UTILITY
yes UTILITY that's of course everyone has to PAY
if everyone has to PAY
UTILITY must be the same they the two of them PAY much more because they are two people
yes but Shi Jun said he's unlikely to let me PAY for one-third exactly
I guess maybe a number between one-third to one-half
yeah anyway that won't be too much
because your base price is low
then you think this one of Wu Ding is still quite good right
maybe it depends on how close he is to school
it's closer to the school it's around
er
you told me you told me about that place
is that right
yes the key is it has an advantage
you may take bus
yes
well you said it
but what's the problem he has to wait till that person would move out at the end of August
um
UH-HUH
doesn't my school start on the twenty-fifth of August
Shi Jing said he's certainly fine to help me move but you the week after next when you come over the next week you maybe have stay at Shi Jing's place
HU-HUH
let's stay here with Shijing
quite troubling
unless you see it somewhere else okay can you move it too
but now I guess there's nothing I asked him today he told me WE HAVE NOTHING NOT A THING
well I think Wu Jing's place is okay I think
Wu Jing you think it's alright right
yeah it's not bad
um that works too anyway he told me
what did Shijing say what was Shi Jing's opinion
er what Shi Jing tried to mean is if there's that ONE BEDROOM EFFICIENCY he thinks I he would rather live there
then it's OK to live in that one didn't you just say it costs three hundred
three hundreds but it doesn't include UTILITIES
yes that
it that close close to the school
which means it's together with Wu Ding's place they are all AMRY WOODS
so you did you go and see that
I haven't seen it otherwise I can call that place tomorrow
is that all right for you to have a look at that when you go to see Wu Jing
yes but I have to make an appointment with him on phone
well just make an appointment and we would have a look together then
yes and then Wu Jing said wait for him he would make some time and take me with him to there on Wednesday morning because it is the time Wu Jing's wife and I are going to meet
that's okay it's up to you
anyway I think maybe both of them are okay well it's not too big a problem
if you were real that is to say
not much convenient whoops oh shit if I knew it earlier now I have bought the ticket
otherwise you could come over and stay with me until you have to go back
but I've already bought two flight tickets today
which two did you buy
I
one is
um
one was sent over on Christmas
oh you still haven't bought the one of the first of September right
no the first of September I still haven't bought it yet
that one of the first of September
still haven't bought it
mainly I went to pay for it later today today
paid so much rent
I had spent a lot of money already today
do you still have money if you don't I can give you
you give me it's not low
you should keep it
maybe you still have to pay for something over there once you have to pay over there you have to pay quite a lot of money in the beginning
when you SETTLE DOWN at the beginning still don't know the rules over there if you have to pay a lot of money plus you get something new for yourself then your money would be almost used up
what
what do I have to submit
if you have to pay more in the beginning
have to submit you mean that place of Wu Jing
yes I don't know how do you have to pay here anyway I have to pay quite a lot
you have to pay for three months in advance
yes
you pay for three months isn't it only five to six hundreds
nine hundreds for three months what five six hundreds
why did you pay so much didn't you say it's over one hundred yuans
yes but well that man who's-his-name still hasn't moved yet which means he would give it to us in the future but now he hasn't moved yet
who
it's Li Lin he would move in in September
oh oh oh
um it's fine at the moment
there are many of these things
it's CREDIT CARD too so not yet for the time being
oh
I I I certainly have enough money I as long as I don't buy a car my money is enough for sure
you're still first
keep some
just find a bank and save it in for urgent need maybe you need money somewhere you know
because after all you just came to here
um
and then it's easier
that is to say
then if it's like this I would just if it's like that I would just leave Wang Yirong and do it on my own
then you if those two anyway you just take a look at those two and you could stay if you think it's okay
I think it's expensive but if Shijing thinks it's okay to live in that one then you can live in that one first
see the LEASE term you know
see if your LEASE must be effective until a specified date
the end of August
you will see
is there any LEASE that can't be terminated until the end of May or so
oh
oh let me tell you best not to sign it to that time
why
because at at then the Olympic Games hasn't started and it's on a holiday might increase more might increase even more
so I hope well if one had to be signed best
best best to sign it to a little bit later
when is the Olympic Games
the Olympic Games July or August
ah
then you just sign it until September
sign it to September the problem is if I wanted to be transferred then what could I do with the house
then you can find a way to SUBLET as you said since the Olympics Games is
coming then it must be easy to rent the house out
you just force up the price then and maybe it also
it could be rented out at a higher price
eh really
that person Shi Jing told me just have one one room just have one room for rent for seven eight hundred he said no problem
I'm sure it won't be any problem that must be during the Olympics Games
ah that's also fine that's also okay that is to sign it for a little bit later
normally the LEASE would be signed till the end of August they are all like this signing for a year
yes so Wu Ding said that that person at his would move out in the end of August so he needed to find another person to SHARE with him
I'm mainly worried that you think it's not suitable
I think it's not suitable
I think you would stay for long time at Shi Jing's place right
because at then if you are
aren't you then if you are going there well
that is four people SHARE one BATHROOM
do you do you think do you think it's convenient
I won't stay too long at there if I go there for example if I am going there on Christmas
think about it
also I uh do you think whether I should give him a heads up about this in advance
we go
let's go to Florida
I know not my intention well
should I give him a heads up in advance
doesn't need to
that is to say I have a friend well probably needs to live or not
hey how come don't think it as you know that's fine you don't even have to bring it up to him this is normal
I went to stay there
it means it's normal this is fine
wait for example if I go there at some time
you can tell him you say my friend is coming for a while something like this this one this is yours
um personal problem he shouldn't he can't control it
oh
you know you don't have to say you tell him this kind of this thing is fine
so if of course when I am about to go for example
you moved in and then I am going there tomorrow you can give him a heads up you can say my friend is coming tomorrow he has to
stay for a while something like that and then just say something and that's it
because you had already rent that house
oh
do you know
and then
this is about you let me to stay there they can't control it
um
we of course that's to say we're going to talk a little bit it just
but anyway anyway you
anyway Shijing always thinks it doesn't matter he feels this way
that is to say it's not a long time either
besides that is to say everyone is expected to hang out for a day or a half and then let's go out for a walk again
it would be passed quickly no problem
too much of that
that's fine
it's okay
ah don't worry what do you think of his one anyway the two of you
UH-HUH
make a comparison
um um
well anyway for EFFICIENCY of course I think it's better to get the expensive one look at the one that Wu Jing lives in and if you think it's okay you may live with him
um
but in that case I would
that is
what should I do during the week when school opens
um
those days
I can't miss class anyway
that that's only a few days
it's only six days plus the time in middle it's surely
there is a Sunday in the middle
Saturday's
that
it doesn't matter there aren't many classes in those days do you start your classes on August twenty fifth
yes
August twenty fifth and August thirty first is it seems that August thirty first is Monday
then you'll be on August twenty fifth ah thirtieth
twenty ninth and August twenty fifth is a
Monday
five six seven eight nine
eleven
two three four five four days that few days of the beginning of the new school year there are not many classes
so it's also a problem for me to come and go and the place I live in is very far from AMRY
have to bother Shi Jing
bother him for two days
it would be the twenty-fifth even if you bother me then what do you do it's been few days only
really can't um
anyway if that person sends POST in AMRY website maybe it will
it will that is to say there will be some news one after another
um it's ok you can think about it
perhaps
you can choose it yourself see how is it
it's okay
my flight is on Thursday
evening I think I think it arrives Atlanta at eight fifteen in the evening
wait for me
I don't have the ticket with me right now
I remember it arrives Atlanta at eight fifteen
the night
um
do you want me to pick you up
or
I think
if not then I won't go to pick you up let Shijing go to pick you up
it works too there's no problem
because if you want if he picks you up then I have to if I went to pick you up again
seriously I have to run half more
why did you pick another one again
oh you mean he's from the class ha
em em em
it's fine yes there's no problem
otherwise
um there's no problem if it's really not ok you can give me the address and I can go there by myself
go to pick you up and then take you to my place
you I I I let me tell you here in Atlanta
well this system is not what you thought yet hum
what do you mean the taxi isn't working
taxi is good but how expensive it is
isn't that finished
oh just twenty or thirty yuan you sound generous now
no it's
when looking back on it I think that four DOLLAR four DOLLAR and REBATE would be returned to you
no I don't want that
that one is
that
I
besides it means this won't
the main problem is it is not necessarily I would take the taxi from the airport directly
SETTLE DOWN at the end of August would be very troublesome that is to say if you SETTLE DOWN at the end of August
that is to say
well hello that is to say when you need to install your telephone or something that is to say I think in other words
it's a little busy that is to say he at the end of August I don't know what exactly when he could move
you can ask him it means tomorrow you can you can ask him about these on Wednesday
for example can you move in a couple of days earlier or
his number and something else you can ask about it you can ask about all these things
with them besides
I mean Wu Jing's place he's also
um
Chinese you and him which means you can get clear on these things in advance
it's okay
right now you still haven't decided to live there hey
um
right you still haven't signed LEASE with him or promised him to live there it's alright
um
you still have other options anyway it's up to you
that is to say
make some judgements according to the situation at the moment because I am not
which means when it's right there or certainly
understand the situation so it's not necessarily that well
I just offer some references
um
and then you just put these things all together
um
never mind
it won't be a big mistake
um
it won't be that
and then that
my this phone call
well that is to say
if it was as usually tomorrow then it should be tomorrow
huh we should be allowed to make
if it was not as usual
not necessarily
ah
um
if I have any questions then I will
that is to say don't worry either
um
just don't worry even if they didn't call because that is to say
I'm going to be in tomorrow evening
well after I got home
only then I could tell AT AND T that is to say I'm going to be
this take this
what's all this about
TRANSFER the phone call
that is to say
that also needs
make it right
I don't know if it comes into effect at that time or in twenty four hours
ah
um
um
it doesn't matter I just make it right
um
hmm anyway
it's still fine
not too
anyway I moved today it was okay
um
then
others here in my place
there won't be any
major issues
you can
come on hurry up get on with your business there
um
and then
you're going to school today tomorrow aren't you
he won't go to tomorrow he will go the day after tomorrow
you're not going to tomorrow
um
that Shijing how is he doing how did he arrange it
he tomorrow he said there're something to deal with in both laboratory and home
just
yes he that is to say he's experimenting now he will go to talk to his boss on Monday that is to say
is it okay did it go well or something
well that's all right
um
that is to say
that is to say there is no much influence on his experiment or something like that
hey what the hell is that sound
um
what the hell is that sound
W
I don't know maybe it's CALL WAITING or something
you don't have to hang up anyway our call will be over after a while
I called just now is he on the phone
yes
he's on the phone
yeah Zhou Jian called him just now
oh you tell him about it that is to say
this phone of yours can't you carry it away
ah
I wear very few clothes right now just like
you put some clothes on
so to speak you just tell him well it will be over very very soon
it won't be Zhou Jian's call if it was called by Zhou Jian the phone will ring I can't hear what this sound is
are you
ah
that might be
a fax or
anyway we'll call again well
it'll be over in less than ten minutes then you just
at then you
after you finish the call you you put some clothes on then return the phone you just tell him you say this half an hour
it's late enough for you to call at this time what if I had been haha that's all right
no I just finished moving
oh me
just returned
ah ah ah
uh I moved in the evening
anyway that means
so can you still use that thing in his language center now
it's being used at the moment didn't you hear just now
I know I said how you could use it at night but I have started just now
I called your laboratory a few minutes ago and no one answered
oh I I left the lab at five o'clock
oh later I remembered that we're going to move tonight and might come back very late that is to say maybe we can't go to the laboratory
I just five o'clock left the lab at half past five then just
came back to prepare for moving and other things alike
just
um
that is at home
does this call have to last for half an hour
um
I think
just just just call call for half an hour it this is probably about information involving it and stuff like that
that you are not me that is to say you basically the things are like that
that is
that is to say you're waiting for that SOCIAL SECURITY CARD and then you haven't done anything else like banking or something
haven't moved any at all hmm
ah
all waiting
so
I might as well seek something just that I might as well find a place to stay and if I stay
that is to say
extremely troublesome because for that school all the forms it's required that just
that address is needed for all forms
it's fine you may fill in that of Shijing first and then you can change it later
that is
it's very easy it's just that your UPDATE that is a just input it into COMPUTER that's it
I just don't know how your school network is that is to say
it may that is to say in some places that is to say once a place is changed all of them will be just input from a COMPUTER and all of them will be changed accordingly
well I don't know
that is such thing is very convenient
because my that um forms are from several OFFICEs just obtained
yeah but the computers in whole school should be networked
well I don't know how is your SYSTEM but that is to say you don't have to wait for all of these things that is to say
well then I have no idea
you could I actually when I came I did everything at the same time
and then then I was just
ah of course I got a PENN ID first and then in that way I was just
ah hum I started to handle a lot of things
and then I changed it again later
just put ID again again as long as I got that
SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER I just changed ID again
oh but Shi Jing told me that according to him not all schools request that the SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER and
ID NUMBER be the same
are you
um he said that their school has no such requirement
so you can also get an ID
I will make a call tomorrow and ask about the several offices' that
um the phone number for those OFFICEs and then call each OFFICE
um
that's okay and then you ask them
that is to have that is you only need to have an ID
you have your school's ID then you could go to a bank to open an account
ah Shi Jing said he said he said no need um he said it seemed he said that even though CITY BANK has branch offices in Atlanta he said that few would just go there oneself
no
and just
just that just that the forms I need to have according to him can all just be sent over by the school
ah okay of course okay absolutely okay
that something that also that thing don't you think about being with CITY BANK
impossible for you to open an account there
of course I don't know what it's like at your place but generally speaking you
not likely
at particularly
big banks to open an account
ah I know you mean for opening an account I can just go somewhere smaller
um
but for applying a card or alike
to apply for a card you wait till
huh just find a place any place I will get two pieces of stuff for you then you fill them in and send them that's it
um
anyway pretty easy anyway
those are not difficult
that
that means you you
today just just being at home or well going out
after going out for a walk well
other things
is is is there anything else you did
nope I just help them in the daytime
pick up two PARCELs from UPS
oh
now they all are not home during the day you are the only one home right
yes and then
four o'clock
Shi Jing came back at four o'clock
ah
it was when you called last time and later
it is said that there's a TEMPLE
what what place
it is fine
later I called that person this morning still not sure
not sure it seems that person doesn't know what's going on
say it
they are acting like this what's going on anyway it's
not quite sure either later
later well I called another Chinese he said that place would definitely have houses and then asked me to call Shi Jing again
he just said said to close before half past five then we just went after we got there first he said seeing was not allowed and then said it was too late and asked where were you from
later that Shi Jing said she came from China so he thought we probably came all along from a distant place
um
and let us to see it
ah
it was that kind of wooden floor without any CARPET
oh that is good
wait for a moment
there is a carpet there is a carpet carpet is rather dirty it's mainly because
what do you mean by pretty good
yes I just talk about the floor
um
hard floor may be better than carpet
let's talk about carpet
no
Shi Jing said it was better without the carpet
yeah I just said it's not as good as carpet
oh
he said it's not as good as carpet
yes
carpet is rather dirty you have to deal with it otherwise the carpet would be dirty
it's easy to get a variety of things or something
are you
yeah it's easy to stick soil just think about it the wool on the carpet is very easy to stick soil
um
wood anyway each has its own
but he said that the wooden floor in other words you need need to clean it yourself but with CARPET you can buy a vacuum cleaner
yes
yes
yes
how are you doing do you still feel tired today every day
it's okay
not too tired anymore
have you overcame the jet leg
adjusting the jet lag anyway of course it's like still feel sleepy at eleven or twelve during the night
but still wake up quite early in the morning
oh I just feel sleepy at eleven or twelve o'clock at night
that's great you're almost done with jet leg
um that is
you don't you feel sleepy at ten o'clock
not yet
ah that's great
I usually do it at eleven o'clock a quarter past eleven or about half past eleven
ah that is right now
um
are you
ah I'm calling
um
I just came over too just came over
I just called my landlord but his line was busy so I hung up and called you
I have to tell him about this
that is
ah
it's about the key or those messy things
em em em
ah yes anyway it's still a little messy now recently
now you three people SHARE one APARTMENT right
in the future
yes there will be three people in the future
how many BATHROOM
there are two
the Chinese can really make do with huh
um
I used to have TWO BEDROOM nope there's only one BATHROOM
oh
for you the living standard has not declined but improved haha
it wasn't improved either that house is probably than this house now
it's maybe a little bigger but not much just a little bigger
and then um
hi this
are you looking for a house
rent
how much is it you all rent right
um
anyway
well hi
just simple that is to say
as long as it's almost okay it's not either
if you're going rent a very good house and then you don't stay at home either
why bother
um
that is to say the place of activity
like the house we used to have there was a piano and LIVING ROOM was quite big
you don't hold PARTY either what's the use of it
is that right
so it's better to be simple
just simple
ah my TEMPLE in that place and there is also a TINY or something
be practical
and also a POOL
um
and PLAY AREA
and then that place
um
well that's pretty good and there is also a BALCONY or something
um
it's called PATIO
um
oh
okay so you just keep it going these two days I think your this looks like
yes we have to keep looking for
I don't think it's too hard perhaps
you got these choices today maybe you would have better choices tomorrow
I don't know anyway I sum up with Shi Jing that there is a peak first in every day
and then there's a trough
peak
trough
we thought it was the peak yesterday
how did we find so many APARTMENT but it was nowhere to find
so we called again today
trough
so scared when came back think it's really a low point
reached the peak again
uh a couple of later then well Shi Jing said that APARTMENT was rented out
well that what
um that thing that that American old lady's was also rented out
that one of Wu Ding's
said that person wasn't going to move
right you are just
yes
but I think these maybe more realistic a little bit
I just felt the one you wanted originally is hard to get but this these I feel a little bit
that is to say it's more likely to get
I think it's more likely to get
so it seems that you're getting better now
read more books when you have time and then do that
reading books all the time
well that's all right take a good look at it
I think need to practice listening
um
the English spoken by black people from the south I can't even understand a little bit
ah
then practice it
really
well have a good practice of that
I've met two black people from the south never understand one of them
ah
each time don't understand either either either either of them
ah
it's ok some of them are more colloquial besides that
it's the same
when you have more experiences in the future after taking some classes you would know
quite difficult anyway while listening to it the general meaning anyway you watch TV watch an interview of some kind a sort of SHOW anyway you can also understand the most but
um
anyway there are always some you can't understand
um
oh
but hey
Hey, what's the matter?
Ah, he said he's going to record us in a minute.
Oh.
OK, then.
Never mind. [laugh]
Hey, listen, he's just set up for recording.
Oh.
Right, so
He'll record what we're saying, when it's finished they'll study, study what they're talking about.
Ah.
Really? [laugh]
Yes. Do n't be alarmed, but... it's OK, [laugh] the foreigners, they are going to conduct a study.
Ah, ah, [laugh] , ah, is this a free phone call?
Right.
Really?
Then we'll just talk, and today we'll [laugh] , we two sisters will sit on the bed and have a chat, [laugh]
Hey, you, um, that person of yours turned up, and, uh, anyway, I gave her the key, and she gave me two hundred dollars, and I also
Hello.
% Er... a check? Did she give you a check?
I did n't want it; I asked her for cash. She said, do you want a check? I said, it would be better in cash, and she said she had to go back and get it for me, she said she did n't have, um, money, but brought her check,
Oh.
Then I said, if you've got cash, give me cash then.
Oh.
Uh, she just gave it to me, and I said the, uh,
What did she look like?
Um, she looked quite nice -- a rather fat woman.
How old was she?
Not old, I think, at most twenty or around twenty.
Ah, so , a young girl, then?
% Uh, not very, not very old -- someone also at school, I think.
Oh, then how come I,% uh, how come I heard the voice of her talking
% hmm, sound, um, sound like she is quite old, she said she has a son, ah.
Quite old, right?
Eh?
She said she has a son.
She has a son, but then there are actually many people with sons who go to university.
Right.
Then she is probably twenty - something at most. [unknown] do n't think she looks very old.
Right , really nice?
She seems OK.
Really? You did n't continue to chat with them for a while?
Um, no.
Oh, I'll just lead her down, she can move in, right?
Yes. I called, but that person was n't there.
Oh.
Originally she, she said if it was OK for her to move in, and I said it was OK, and I said I would make a phone call and see if that person was in, but he was n't.
Oh.
Oh.
She asked whether she, she could go in by herself, and I said that would be OK, er, and so she went herself, %pw, by herself, and then I bumped into her once in the elevator,
Right.
OK.
Oh.
She just, she just just told me, everything, all her things had all been moved in.
Really?
Uh-huh.
Oh.
Anyway, you, you, your family has taken away everything of value, right?
They're all in the closet.
There are n't any valuable %pw, [laugh] , hmm, hmm
Right, there is n't anything valuable -- they've all been thrown into the closet.
Ah, ah, ah.
Right. Then she'll be OK. Go and make it. Make it for a month and then see how it goes, and come back and clean up the mess.
Hmm.
Un-huh, uh-huh.
How about that? [unknown]
new uh Hey, do n't do it! Did you hear that?
Hear what?
The sound of a large electric fan and the sound of that air conditioning, whirring and blowing [unknown] every day
Oh.
It's hot.
It blows so much it makes your head ache.
It must be hot over there, right?
Once once the car drove into Wharton's, still several hundred damn meters away from his home at Wharton's , I just wanted to drive back, and turn round and leave.
Ah.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Ah.
Gosh, what the hell was this? I could n't stay one minute in this place [unknown] .
It's hot.
I fell ill right after I got back.
Really?
Absolutely. Not to say how hot it was, those blacks, huh,
Hmm.
When you drive behind,
he'll be honking their horns behind you.
Honking their horns -- is that so?
Yes, you see, you get [unknown] constantly alarmed and are shocked half to death. [laugh]
I really want to wet my pants. [laugh]
Take no notice of him.
Yes â€“ Would you say this type of thing does n't happen in Canada?
It does. How could it not? I am often honked at by people, and it also happened today -- there were really loads of cars at the, the entrance to the road,
Er,
and so I thought if I could n't turn left, I'd just turn right,
Ah.
and he just honked his horn behind, honked his horn at me, and I said how damn wicked he was. What are you in such a hurry to get going for? There were so many cars there, and we did n't want to have a fatal collision.
Flashed his lights at you?
Right.
I was so mad.
[laugh] yea.
It was infuriating, you see.
Did you get annoyed? He honked frequently, unlike here, um, wherever.
Hmm.
Over there, um, where we are, uh, he just [unknown] honked at you when he got to the intersection.
Hmm.
He was tailgating you,
and he then honked at you.
Uh-huh.
He honked at you when he saw you driving slowly, would n't you say it was infuriating?
Do n't, do n't -- take no notice of him. Do n't get flustered.
Oh, yes. The thing is that I was not used to it at the start, and at first it made me so damn frightened that I trembled, when I got startled again, I trembled again.
Uh-huh.
My heavens! [laugh]
Gosh, %pw, uh, after I had finished driving back home,
Uh-huh.
I was really tired -- did you find it tiring when you had just started to learn to drive?
That was indeed tiring, well, you ca n't, think of it, every,
Very stressful, you know?
Uh-huh.
Concentrating your mind always on that spot.
Uh-huh, yes, yes, anyway, you just every, hmm.
Christ, you must be worried there'll be an accident.
But now I'm really bold, damn it, I've been getting on the freeway all the time.
OK, that's fine, then. In that case, after a few rounds of driving, there definitely wo n't be any problem with your test.
Hey, I do n't think there'll be a problem. I guess I can succeed in one go, I do n't think I'll be able to wait until the 1st. I think I have to go back on the 20th or something. Once the test is over, I'm going back.
Ah, ah.
Ah.
Ah.
What date is his test?
Anyhow, I ca n't even wait a minute, [laugh] and my husband said, hey, in that case, I wo n't be able to go back with you guys either. I'll only be able to go on the 10th [unknown] , how about waiting until the 10th? I said I could n't.
Ah. [laugh]
I basically could n't. Damn it, I'm suffocating to death over here. It's stifling and hot.
Really?
I stink of sweat the whole day.
And it does n't rain that much either,
There was a tiny bit of drizzle, drizzle today.
Ah, ah.
Today, I actually wanted to go there the whole day, and I drove, damn it, drove an hour and a half to a park for something fun to do, ha,
Ah, ah, ah.
You see, the gas money had all been spent, but after arriving there, I had n't spent that long time having fun, when it was once again, gosh -- it was just like that day when we went to the [unknown] [unknown] [unknown] [unknown] [unknown] Sports World -- it was that hot.
Ah, ah, ah.
Ah, ah.
So dry, you know?
Ah, ah. [unknown]
I got back, gosh, yes, I picked some peaches.
Find a beach, okay, a beach
What was that?
Find a beach, because I did n't inquire about it, as people everywhere said there was a beach, ha,
Yes.
The beach there only had gambling venues and nowhere to swim.
Really?
Yes, just gambling, and I did n't want to go gambling. I'm really not good at gambling. We did n't , we've all now believed in this god, we're all people who believe in God, and really ca n't do that thing.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Oh, I mean we just ca n't, ca n't go and gamble -- gambling is not allowed.
Oh, gosh. I, fortunately, I might -- you two, mother and daughter, quite enjoyed yourselves , and fortunately did n't
come along, that would be a real suffering.
Hmm.
Or that would n't do -- I do n't want to stay here even for one day.
OK, let's discuss it after you've taken your test, finished your test.
Oh?
Let's discuss it after you've taken your test.
Right! After taking that test, there will be no problem driving to your home when I am going back.
If I drive to your home, I will drive straight there on the freeway, hey, I can go directly on the %pw.
Hmm.
Just us two sisters, go straight to London, to Toronto for sightseeing, ha.
Uh-huh.
Hey, when I get back, we can go on a trip to Toronto.
Oh, you're [unknown] daring
And then when we come back, we go to London on another trip.
[laugh] You're really daring, I mean it. [laugh]
Oh, I am extremely daring; I [unknown]
Uh-huh.
Oh, you do n't believe that I go on the freeway?
Oh, I remember that you, at that time, gosh, were totally soaked in sweat. [laugh]
Hmm.
[laugh] Even your hair stood on end. [laugh]
All of a sudden.
Haha, yes. It's been ages and ages since I drove, has n't it? Just imagine if I drove onto it all of a sudden, then it would really give me a big fright! [laugh] The main thing is that I had n't mentally prepared for it, had I?
[laugh] I was driving on the freeway today, and there were two little girls sitting behind me, and I said, =damn, I've got a friend, and then I gave your experience,
Yes.
Hmm.
Uh-huh.
Hmm.
Yes.
She had been driving for six months,
Right.
and got her driver's license six months ago, but the moment she went onto the freeway, her hair stood on end.
[laugh] What about now? Do you dare go on it now?
It's a bit better now. It was just that time when your husband came all for a visit, and it's, it's much better.
You went for a spin, huh?
I'm telling you, if you do n't let anyone go behind you, sit behind you, then you can get better in no time.
Oh.
Uh-huh, yes, that would be much better. In that case, I'm not that frightened anymore.
Right?
Right.
Uh-huh.
I think I'd actually feel a little better if Wang Yusheng sat beside me.
Um, that's right.
Yes.
He would actually keep an eye on the roads for you.
Yes, right.
After that, yes, after that, he could tell you how to change lanes and so on.
Yes, that's right. If you're both watching the road and doing that something yourself, you will get a little nerve - wracking. If you're not looking, not looking at the road, then it'd be OK, hmm.
Sometimes, I'm not good at changing lanes by myself.
Right!
Right!
When it comes to watching the road, our speed is also so fast it would not be appropriate, you know? For one thing, the speed is fast, and then you do n't dare let your eye glance over to some other place.
Uh-huh.
[laugh] Yes, right.
If you're always looking at other places, what could you do if you fell off ?
Yes, right.
Gosh, when I come back, now I'm more or less used to driving on the [unknown]
Hmm.
When I had just got back,
Hmm.
That evening after I [unknown] [unknown] got home, I did n't sleep a wink all night.
What?
When I got back, when I drove back, it was like I suddenly got a feeling
was n't I too daring, how could I â€“ was n't this playing with your life?
[laugh] Hmm.
I regret it, you know? The whole night I thought that this damn family of three people were in the car, were n't you playing this game?
Uh-huh.
My older brother was also sleeping next to me,
Hmm.
and the child was also asleep.
Oh, gosh.
I was the only one with eyes open, driving.
Oh, that's no good, that is, driving.
Hey, and there was a deep cavern right besides us.
[laugh] God, there was only one road to take.
Really? Gosh, that was, that was probably
Gosh! My God! You do n't even know. After I got unto that% hmm Highway No. 9, there was a deep cavern over there.
Hmm.
I was driving totally on a big mountain slope, and it was the same as, um, on an airplane, with the ears
Ah.
Ah.
What did my ears feel like? Just like that whooshing sound on an airplane, my daughter said it just felt like there was some swelling in her ears.
So
Ah, really?
Yes.
Uh-huh.
We had really an experience.
[laugh] We went through an ordeal. [laugh]
Um, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Diana's Mom, do you want to speak to Diana's Mom?
Hey, I miss you.
You do n't want to, [laugh] do n't want to, [laugh] he's playing here, right, I, uh, have two friends coming over here to spend some time.
Spend time with whom?
It seems like there are so many people at your home.
Oh! Are the two friends in your home?
Hmm, never mind. Just a few over there with him quite a few children, I mean Tony and the others, Tony.
I heard this uh how come there is chattering in that room uh-huh
Congcong and the others are there, are n't they?
Oh, listen
And, um, there is that, that young girl, who is in the same school as your, who, Diana, as well as her younger brother. Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Oh, right. I can hear and recognize their voices now.
OK! You're doing really damn well over there?
Hey, anyway, I feel [laugh]
How do you feel?
Are you missing me?
Just muddling along, missing you â€“ even if I miss you, I do n't, do n't have your phone number. [laugh]
Exactly, damn,
Gosh, you do n't even have my phone number. My roommate has it, I mean, um , she has it.
Has she?
Hmm.
OK. Do n't phone me then. Why would you keep on calling for no reason?
Next time, just that what - do - you - call - it,
Hmm.
and when I go back this time, let's go on another trip to Toronto.
OK.
I think they're still changing the venue, my husband said.
You and Little Wang,
% er just go once every two weeks.
One shopping trip.
Go where? To Toronto?
Ah.
Ha, no. There's no need. And it's actually not that cheap either, in Toronto.
Then there's no need for it.
It's not cheap at all.
Because , um, you also need to look for, look for somewhere to park the car.
Yes, right.
Hmm, it's hard to park.
Yes, gosh!
Hmm.
The gas money alone will cost a damn 10 dollars or so.
Yes, it definitely will if you go into Chinatown.
Hey, you see, this driving,
If you mean, you mean, to buy something, um, unusual, something we have n't got here, then it would be OK to make a trip over there.
Yes.
Would it be more or less 10 dollars if we took the [unknown] [unknown] for one hour on the freeway?
Hmm, more or less, yes.
Not quite?
More or less.
Is that more or less, right?
Uh-huh.
Yes, I think it would actually come damn close to that, because we would be driving on the freeway there [unknown]
To drive there once, go there once every month or two would be OK, just to buy some things we do n't have, um, over here,
Yes.
We have everything over here, too, just think,% er, the gas would actually cost about the same amount of money.
Yes, and there is n't even
There is n't even anything worth buying.
What does the gas money come to now?
Five point something?
Fifty %pw, it is just over fifty - one today.
Gosh!
It's got even cheaper!
That's OK, hmm. Is the gas cheaper where you, you are?
Oh.
The gas over here is just over 1 dollar 10.
Just over 1 dollar 10, really?
Yes, who knows, [unknown] ?
That's more or less the same as Canada once everything is included, I meant even if it was for a one - day trip,
Hmm.
you still have to go, let me calculate, I made a trip today, for the whole day, um, did n't we go and come back on the freeway,
it also came to nearly 10 dollars, for one
Oh.
More or less.
Uh-huh.
Right.
Do you want me to bring anything along for you?
No, no, and anyway, hey, at the moment the fewer things, the better.
Uh uh?
Hey, um, where did you decide to get the apartment in the end?
Still that, %pw, just at that place where that friend of mine is, I'll just go and live at his place for a while.
Oh
Which one?
Just on Madison , the one I, I, I, I, I told you about before, I have a friend, who, I say, lives in that small building.
Oh, still that home, that building, did n't the landlord give you a phone call?
Ah.
Never mind. He said it was n't my fault.
It is that person, that superintendent â€“ he does n't, does n't understand English, right?
Oh.
It turned out when he filled in that form, there were many parts that he, he did not fill in.
Oh.
He then asked me to take a look, and get him to sign it and so on. He was also really muddled - headed, and asked,
Oh.
Oh, I mean, I [unknown] even do n't understand English?
That's right. That person he hired ca n't understand English, and I said, um, you tell %pw, you tell me what he could, could do, I said.
My God!
Really?
Oh.
And then I [unknown] paid the money, and it turned out he still said that I had n't paid any money. You see, this and I say, um, the memory is n't good either, I said.
Oh, my God!
I said then I just took the deposit, the, um, deposit, take it over there, right?
Yes.
Ah.
So later, that, the former old superintendent gave it to him and said, take a look -- the money has been paid, and you still said that the person had not paid the money, and so on.
So, um, how come that, that, %pw, superintendent find someone like that, that [unknown] superintendent?
Who knows? The former one, the former person, he has now probably found a full - time job.
Oh.
And then he just, just quit.
Oh.
And then he, um,
If it does n't work, we buddies just go and do it for him.
[laugh] Yes. Someone in his place over there -- who knows? How could they find this family? Is it because they've lived there a long time? It must be?
Ah, yes.
Probably, he
If he's lived there a long time, they probably just hired him -- that's what it was.
Yes, right.
Oh, is that apartment OK? What is it like?
It's a bit small, um, anyway, I'll stay there for a while and see what happens.
It's a bit small, is that right?
They
move into,
There's space to move into, right?
% Er, what date is the move - in?
I do n't know. It seems that that person will probably move out on the twenty - fifth.
Hmm
I think I may move on the same day as he does. %pw,
Wo n't you ask him to tidy things up for you?
Him?
Ah.
Not really
Are n't you asking him to give it a lick of paint for you?
In any case, the apartment is actually quite clean, and he said if it's clean he wo n't paint it. Just the kitchen -- I think when I move in, I'll ask him to change the paper in the kitchen anyway, and it'll probably do.
Oh.
Because I want to, that is to say, jointly rent a car with that person.
Hmm.
So, so is n't it
Forget that then, [unknown] are n't you going to wait for me to come back and help you move?
Could n't that save a bit of money?
Hmm It's fine by me -- I'll go back and help you move.
OK then, OK then. You wo n't need to worry in that case -- you just need to do well on that driving test of yours, hmm? You're not taking the test until after the 20th?
do well on my [unknown] test
Yes.
I, now -- after I take the written exam,
Hmm.
When it's over, I'll go and make an appointment for the road test.
Uh-huh.
When the written exam is over, after I've taken the exam,
The situation now is that I'm waiting for the official, um, driver's [unknown] -- I mean for the arrival of the official driver's %pw.
Uh-huh.
I'll drive with a provisional permit for now.
Uh-huh.
I can only make an appointment after the official one has arrived -- that is, arriving next week,
Ah, ah, you can only make an appointment by then?
% Er
make an appointment.
Uh-huh.
So I can make an appointment for another week later.
Uh-huh.
That's how it is, so if we calculate it from now there are still three weeks to go.
Ah, ah.
Two and a half weeks or I'll go back.
Uh-huh.
I do n't =know what date two and a half weeks turns out to be, uh?
OK, then. In any case, you, you concentrate on your test -- what, what date does your school start?
I [unknown]
[breath] What date in my case?
September?
My school starts sometime after the 10th.
Your school does n't start until the 10th, after the 10th?
You've forgotten that our, um, school starts on, um, the 11th.
Ah, so there's no need for you to worry.
No, I was just thinking, gosh, I do n't want to stay here
It's too hard over here, and every day, um, the whole day you have to, um,
Uh-huh.
Just like staying in a refrigerator.
When you go out, that heat wave just rushes in towards you.
Uh-huh.
You see, you simply ca n't, %pw, and besides the kid ca n't go out to play either, I even
almost fell really ill from being cooped up yesterday.
Hmm.
When I got back home, I just had to stay cooped up there, and today I =finally got a Saturday, and quickly rushed out for some fun.
Uh-huh.
And husband has classes every day, is busy and not at home?
Uh-huh, uh-huh, hmm Me?
looking after the child all day.
What have you been doing on your own these past two days?
Eh?
Uh, in any case, I can borrow some videotapes, and what I do now is watch videos at home.
Watch videos, you [unknown] do n't have anything to do now either?
Yes.
Oh, um, have you decided on that matter of attending school?
More or less, I think.
Anyway, there's no need to worry about that.
What date? I'll go register on August 20th, on the 29th.
Hmm.
After registration, after registration, there's just nothing else to do, right?
There's nothing else to do again.
After registration, what else is there? Just wait to attend class, and classes begin on September 5th.
Oh, Jameson is crying. What's up, Jameson, my little dear?
Um, a little child hit him a couple of times,
The two of them were, um, snatching, snatching that,
Oh, have n't you cooked any dinner yet?
No. They're eating.
They're eating, then quickly go and do whatever you have to do.
They've finished eating, never mind, they've finished eating. Hmm.
Oh.
What else do you have to talk about, just think.
Nothing.
There's nothing to report back, hey, has that roommate of yours moved out?
Moved out.
Oh, is n't that -- God even more spacious for you two.
Ah, yes. That's why I just [unknown] asked them to come over and play.
[laugh] They'll just kick up a fuss for no reason, paid it. What did you say she said the other day, the other day?
Oh, did she pay you the money?
Aha,
She said she'd give me one hundred and fifty, and I said that would not do, and I said, you two people are living here, and I said that I,
Oh, gosh. My God!
Yes!
Oh, what did she say?
She just, was n't that, um, she, I bought that something from her, um, um, I bought her electric rice cooker and whatever else -- I bought them all.
The microwave oven?
Did you buy the microwave oven?
Did you buy them all?
Yes. I bought them. I had n't given her the money all this time, right? So I told her I wanted them.
wanted them, and then, afterwards she [unknown] never gave me the money, either. I then got worried about it, and early in the morning the other day I asked her younger sister for it.
Ah.
Her younger sister said her older sister would give it.
Oh.
And then at some point in the evening, she said, I'm leaving tomorrow and so on, uh,
Oh.
and so I said, oh, and made a couple of polite remarks to her.
Yes.
And then she said again, um, if you want these two things, they'll be one hundred and thirty, and could I pay you one hundred and fifty this month? I, I thought she, that is to say,
Oh, gosh. I [unknown]
did n't want this one hundred and thirty and then would pay me one hundred and fifty, so I said it was OK. In any case, she would be giving me 20 dollars too little, uh,
Right.
In the end, she just gave, gave me 20 dollars,
Ah.
So I said, that will not do, I said %pw, I said, the two of you live here, I said besides, I usually do n't ask you for much money, do I?
Right.
Right.
Right, and she said, Ok, so she went to get me the money, I, well, you are really bad.
I said I, er, I said that I usually, I, you see, the two of you are living here, and who else would let you stay for three hundred dollars?
Really?
Yes.
Yes.
And it was also so, um, whatever, I said
Yes.
I said, that wo n't do, it wo n't do, and then, anyhow, she said %pw, and finally gave me it, and said anyway, give me it and be done with it.
Right.
Yes.
Oh.
Oh, did you buy all of those things of hers?
Yes. I just bought those two things, or else, anyway, in this way, if someone comes,
Who did she sell that bed to, that bed of hers?
The bed â€“ just that, that, that person downstairs, whose husband died.
Really? Does she really want hers?
At the beginning she said that she would never want it, would never want it, and as a result, she kept on going to their home to speak to her about it.
Oh.
She said, later on she said fifty dollars, and she bought it.
Fifty dollars, is there the thing below the bed?
She, um, had a bed, that bed, bed frame is very low, and that, uh, is made of wood.
Oh.
Oh.
Did n't she also have that [unknown] behind the bed?
No, no, she did n't, she did n't have the headboard and other things.
Fifty dollars, when there was n't anything there? Too
Oh, so stingy!
too expensive!
Who Hey, who knew whether she was or not, in any case, she gets along quite well with that person.
Eh?
She gets along quite well with that person. Later she, yes, that woman later called, and she said she would come and get the bed, and I said, how come she has n't carried off the bed?
Just with that
Ah.
I even even said who she gave it to -- and in the end, the next day she called, and she said that she had bought the bed -- hey, who knows?
Oh.
Oh. How much did she sell the electric rice cooker to you for?
What?
The electric rice cooker?
Sixty - five.
Even sixty - five for the electric rice cooker, how come you wanted it?
I, anyway, I thought it was OK.
Really? That one was also sixty - five, the microwave oven was also sixty - five?
Yes.
Yes. In any case, I wanted, oh, to buy one and be done with it. I thought that one was actually, they all said it was more or less OK. And she said [unknown] over one hundred, [unknown]
Really?
What about the microwave oven?
The microwave oven was more than one hundred and thirty, that's true, well, I saw an ad that day, with the same [unknown] brand, and while it's on sale it is over one hundred and thirty.
Oh.
Oh, in that case, it's OK.
Then it's half price, is n't it? In any case, it's also okay to buy one to %pw, heat up rice and what - not with from time to time. I say, once you start to attend school, you would n't have much time to heat things up using a pot or whatever.
That's OK, that's OK, then.
Yes.
Yes, yes, yes! Right, I, when I, um, got back to America and saw the prices, they are all really expensive.
Really?
Yes, I also want to buy a computer, a computer
I
I think that% hmm
386 is long outdated, this brand.
Yes, right.
No one even uses them any more, right?
Hmm.
They're still four or five hundred.
Four or five hundred -- that price sounds about right.
Four or five hundred US dollars.
Um, over here, oh, I do n't know, four or five hundred
Well, the problem with 386 is.
Yes.
So if you're getting one there or whatever, if it is
two [unknown] 486's, then
they're just four or five hundred in Canada, are n't they?
In Canada? I do n't expect so. They wo n't be, wo n't be. Well, when that friend of mine, when he left last year, he
Hmm.
They wo n't be?
Eh?
left in November last year, he actually sold that 386 of his for more than eight hundred.
Oh, really?
Hmm, so it wo n't be that cheap. So the 486 will not be that cheap.
Oh, they wo n't be.
386, [unknown] is n't of any use anymore, right, 38 %pw? Is that one of yours a 386?
Yes, a 386, in any case the most basic sort, it's still fine.
You could make do with it and it would be OK.
Yes, yes, the most basic functions. As long as, I mean, you have to save some things on it, and you get your husband to copy some things, some copies, for you
OK, if that does n't work,
OK.
For general use, something like lotus,
Right, and what other things would there be?
In general just those two, and also, um, also,
In any case, people generally use WordPerfect a bit more often, and then, I mean, it depends on what major you study, and if you want to study, um,
accounting, there is a lot of accounting software, and you can ask him, see if he has it, to give you an accounting package on it.
Yes.
Yes.
Oh, you, um, er, this copy and whatever to bring along, you have to buy everything yourself, right? So bringing this?
Hey, his school has some of them, and you just, just make a copy from the school's one. If I buy it myself, how could I afford it? They're all really expensive.
You do n't buy it yourselves, right?
Those of mine, anyway, are all copied by other people for me.
Oh.
OK.
My buddies [unknown] still
Hmm, have you finished eating?
[unknown] I did n't tell you -- we went to have a pizza and, um, have just got back.
Oh, pizza, um, and you've just got back, hmm.
Just finished it.
Terribly tired, gosh!
Hmm.
After I got back, I really felt it's really great over here, people.
Really?
Compared with Canada, gosh! Our, um, church events, hey.
Hmm, the moment you talk about [unknown] just
I'm telling you, you'd find it moving, you'd find it emotionally moving, emotionally,
Really? That is, the church is great, right? And the people in the church are great?
Eh?
The people in church are [unknown]
Er, quite nice, are n't they,
Uh-huh.
Those events, organizing these people for events,
That is
I mean, our church went on a trip,
and how much money did we have to pay per person %pw?
[unknown] So how [unknown] money did we pay last time?
Did you pay it? Seven dollars.
Seven dollars, last time, and I paid it -- could you get out of paying it?
Er, no, oh, not this money, um, it was someone's birthday on that, that day.
Oh, not paid yet.
Not paid yet?
Hmm.
Seven dollars, he said.
Really? In that case, rush back, and pay it as quickly as can be.
Let's talk about it later, in any case, talk about it later after you get back, I, I, have n't paid it yet.
In that case, go back and
Really?
Hmm.
Gosh.
Hmm.
The other people over here are all, all, %pw, they are all, we do n't mean we're [unknown] whatever, we're seeking, um, these petty advantages, right?
Uh-huh.
Hmm.
They're all people like that. They are really very conscientious and careful to do the right thing,
Oh, uh-huh, hey, I was going to ask you, um, has that America got any welfare institutions?
Supporting these church events.
Hey!
I just feel really moved,
Yes, it has.
It's like the, um, er, if you are in difficulty, where would you turn to get monetary donation?
Ah...
Ah...
[laugh] Hmm? I do n't know.
For monetary donation, um, I do n't,
I do n't actually know about monetary donation.
There is n't any. Regarding that friend of mine, her, um, her mother is probably allowed to leave hospital soon, and when she leaves hospital, she's thinking of sending her back to China.
Who would contribute the money?
She wo n't,
Ah.
Ah.
She herself, she said she will do it. How could she do it? Anyhow, she said that to send her back to China would cost at least 30,000 dollars, you say
Ah.
Gosh. Why is that then?
Ah?
Why?
Well, she's got to [unknown] um, that is to say, not %pw, if it's a chartered plane, it would come to 6,000, 60,000.
Why would she need a chartered plane?
Well, she must have a special nurse, and if it's not, I mean, if it's not a chartered plane, and she takes an ordinary passenger plane,
Hmm.
% er, and then you at least have to find a special nurse,
Oh.
to follow along, it would come to at least, at least, 30,000 dollars, and she said there's no way she could afford to pay it.
Really?
She goes, why is she thinking of sending her back? The medical facilities over here are really great.
Oh, gosh, really she does n't, does n't have that whatever either, she herself, she's also
How could she manage to do it? You do n't even know, do you, you know what time she wakes up? And in a year or two, it would all drag on over there,
Why?
A vegetable she's become a vegetable.
This illness is n't an ordinary illness either. If people like her come round, it would be OK, but she, um, has n't actually come round,
Has she come round yet?
No. She's still like that.
Just like a vegetable?
Hmm.
I'm telling you,
Hmm.
Hey, then I could find out, find out for you, because there is someone over here where we are,
I have such a friend -- not really a friend - as I do n't really know him.
Hmm.
And through the friend I got to know a young man,
Uh-huh.
and this young man had to
work illegally, and he did n't have [unknown] either, that wife of his was, [unknown]
Hmm.
had that L visa, that is, um
going to school, on a scholarshp, and this young man was classed as visiting relatives, like the type of visiting relatives that we are doing,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
That meant he did n't have the citizenship, right? But her man went to work.
Uh-huh.
While he was working, he =took the elevator up on one occasion,
and from the [unknown] -- he was, um, on that kind of freight elevator, not like those elevators with doors that we use. That elevator had no doors and was all loaded with goods,
Oh.
Uh-huh.
and he fell all the way down from that elevator, and died immediately from the impact.
He fell down?
Yes.
He did n't die when he fell down -- he was just like what you were saying, that is, he became a vegetable.
Uh-huh.
His brain and skull all, all, um, came open, but he did n't die.
Ah.
He was still alive and breathing.
Hmm.
Gosh, but whatever institution he was taken to, people looked after him for free.
Ah, ah.
But I just did n't know whether his, um, mother,
In her case, anyhow, they did n't ask her for the money for the drugs anyhow, and I think, probably
Oh, they did n't even ask her for anything - why was that?
It was definitely because they [unknown] knew that he could n't pay it anyway.
In any case, they just, for her, that is to say, they applied for a something, or other for her, but she did n't even know, she said she did n't even know whether [unknown] could be approved and cover .
Right.
Oh.
But, anyway, they did n't even, never even asked her for, asked her for the money. They actually knew they were poor people, and there was no way they could afford to pay it, it came to several thousand dollars a day, like she stayed
Really?
How long -- more than a month, I think?
Yes.
That's right.
So I told you, I'm telling you, Little Wang, you listen to me.
There's basically no need to worry,
Hmm.
So at the time you, you said, gosh, there's no way they could afford to pay it, and America is just like that,
Hmm.
If you fall ill, uh,
it is said this thing happens or that thing happens, and they pay for you,
[breath] Hmm.
but if you really fall ill and go into hospital, poor
after you go in and he sees you are a poor person, he wo n't ask you for money or anything at all,
Uh-huh. Well, she is just, she's just feeling mentally anxious.
Did n't I tell you earlier on?
There's no need for you to be concerned,
so you
There will be many forms to fill in,
Hmm.
Hmm, let you, he wo n't throw you out onto the street or anything, anything like that.
Uh-huh.
Right.
Like what she said to you about that chartered flight, nurse and so on,
Yes.
you tell her to go, there's no problem.
That's for sure.
There's no problem?
No problem.
Yes Do n't you worry.
I do n't know. She said, anyhow, she said, anyhow, the hospital said she should contact the embassy, and she said the people in the embassy would definitely not %pw, would take no notice of you.
So he said, um, I previously
There's no need for you to worry.
Take no notice, then you just do n't think take her out of the hospital, that's all, take no notice.
Hmm.
Right, there is no problem at all.
You, like, um, I %pw, I said back then, then all look for a [unknown] mercy organization, that is
Hmm.
a charitable organization, right?
There's no need to take any notice.
Hmm.
He wo n't, say, gosh, we can see you're ill, and we're going to throw you out onto the street and ignore you, and then fiercely demand money from you after you go in.
Hmm.
They wo n't.
That wo n't happen.
Well, if they ask for it, there is n't any, ah, [unknown]
So it, right, so she just is n't this this all cover for her?
Hmm.
You, even the hospital stay expenses are all cover for her, right?
I think it should be so, and in any case she has n't got any money herself, and in any case [laugh]
Right.
Right, everything is cover for her, hey, has n't her husband got a job?
He has a job. You mean, er, those tens of thousands of dollars he earns a year?
They also need room and board, and she said that that place of hers is also very expensive, on Long Island, where rich people live.
Yes.
Yes.
The living expenses are particularly high, she said.
Yes, yes, the living expenses are really high.
What work does her husband do, then?
He is, he does some kind of traffic management, it seems, yes, hmm.
Fairly ordinary
He works in a company,
he works in a company, right?
Where do you go to donate money, however much money you donate, how much money you can donate, enough for her to do what?
Hmm.
There are now many things for you to donate money for, and people even, some do n't even believe, you know?
Uh-huh.
Some people just go and donate money nowadays this neighbor of mine is a
% hmm, Christian, right?
So just noticed some people call him every day and ask him to donate money, and he gives it, he always donates, he even gets fed up of giving.
Hmm.
Hmm, hmm, which ones are genuine, and which ones are fake.
He said he really does n't know [unknown] [unknown] these want to do
Right, so do n't depend on any donations, er, or on this or that.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
It's totally meaningless.
You just let her rely on
Just do n't pay anything to it -- there is n't anything it can do either.
Right, there's nothing at all it can do.
It, hospital, it will think of a way, you just say
Uh-huh.
there's no [unknown] even if she is taken out of hospital. I think it should first let you leave the country or whatever, go back to China,
Hmm.
No matter what, he has to think of a way for you.
Would n't you agree?
Hey, there's nothing that she can do either, anyway.
OK!
Right, hmm.
As her friends, we can think about it
There's no use keeping on thinking about it either, thinking about it wo n't lead to anywhere.
As for me coming back this time, gosh, I'm really going to
I just went out with the people in our church, and when I looked and made a comparison, gosh!
What it is is that our people in Waterloo are also very, um, whatever, but [unknown] as soon as I got back, I really [unknown]
Not the same, uh? Um, so I, I actually have felt a little discouraged over here, too often, too, damn it
Oh, not the same at all.
It's so lifeless over here - oh!
Yes, I often do n't really, I often do n't really want to take part in those events.
Gosh! That lifeless,% er, fellowship!
It's just those same few people, and sometimes you do n't really want to go there,
and over here where we are, if you do n't go, they wo n't call on you, and so all go enthusiastically.
Uh-huh.
Really buzzing.
Uh-huh.
It's all so
Today
[unknown] as for going to that pizza, every day, there is that group, every week, that fellowship,
Uh-huh.
[unknown] Close to two or three hundred people, all like that.
Uh-huh.
Everyone talking and laughing together, really buzzing, and what's more, the people are also all
Hmm.
Hey, there are how many, about, talented people, you see
Some teach singing,
Ah, ah, ah.
Some, um, [unknown] [unknown] read, read the Bible to everyone.
Uh-huh.
Oh, it was arranged really perfect by those people, and those
This, I just think, seems like socializing, that is, after you go there, it seems [breath]
not much discussion is on that aspect, all are interacting as if that something, that is, not very comfortable.
I do n't know whether we here, %pw, you there, [unknown]
The main thing is that over here, we do n't have people who take the lead, you know.
Right, right.
You just relied on those few students, Hu Wei and the others, how great abilities could, could they have.
Right, right, right.
If you look at these people, they all
came to America many years ago.
Hmm.
And then their economic circumstances also allowed them to,
also good, ah,
Hmm, yes.
Uh-huh.
And besides, they organized everyone together , everyone get together and mutually,
Hmm.
Hey, really happy.
Uh-huh.
It feels really great.
As for today, I actually checked out such a person for you.
Hmm, [laugh] uh-huh.
A young man.
called, called,
really.
Oh, since I got back, I have actually been pondering it,
and I have to go and ask about it tomorrow, but this young man [unknown] does n't have any official occupation.
Hmm.
That's right, but that person is really great.
Hmm.
That person is really quite good - looking.
What?
As a person, um, he's pretty good.
Oh.
Yes.
As a person he's quite nice too.
But his work is just average,
just an average [unknown]
Average job, what work? Attending school there?
He has n't gone to school over here.
He's not in school at present, just doing something ordinary in an ordinary American company. Yes, his annual salary is just twenty or thirty thousand or something like that.
Uh-huh.
Right!
He, that guy, has n't had the [unknown] for many years,
Hmm.
Damn, he's actually quite tall, he must be one meter, one meter seventy - eight, as tall as that.
Hmm.
As a person, as a person, I actually think he's OK, and today I suddenly found myself sitting with him. [breath]
Hmm.
It suddenly occurred to me, oh [mouthnoise]
That guy is just single , uh, and for many years has not had
a girlfriend, you see, and just came out on his own by himself.
I then chatted with him, I said, you now [unknown] [unknown] what, he? hey, is n't this that I'm too busy, and have n't gone back to do it , have n't had time to think, so, in America
[unknown] [unknown] there are fewer girls, you
want him to go back to China, he says he could n't, as he is so busy.
Hey, put it off till later.
[unknown] I'm constantly thinking about that.
Hey, I say, that, my husband said, this is far away, can it work? I said, just trick him into going to Canada.
It has n't occurred to me that we would have another fellowship event next week, and I'll ask him again.
Hmm.
Oh, there are many people over here, you know? This contact is extensive, you know,
Hmm.
Hmm.
Everyone speaks Mandarin.
When we go to that church, they all speak Cantonese, and when we bow our heads there is n't even one person who speaks to us.
Right, when I go, I just feel uncomfortable.
Is n't that cold and heartless, cutting you off over there, and when you go to the Mandarin - speaking fellowship, there are just those few people who stare at each other, and there are just those little bits of things.
Hmm.
[laugh] Hmm.
You say that here you, you this time it is widespread.
Uh-huh.
It's particularly bustling when everyone is together, and you know everything that goes on.
Uh-huh.
It's really very good.
So, you today, like us immigrating to Canada, we, today they all go to our church.
Ah, ah.
all, all apply, everyone, you tell me and I tell you, you know, know the information, do you know?
Everyone spreads information, because it's all like that when they're together.
Hmm.
Uh-huh.
So, like me, um, I just, everyone asks me, hey, how are you doing? How, how are you.
Uh-huh.
Now there are several who are all going for an interview [unknown] next month.
Oh, if those people are going, as a result our ranks will really grow in number.
Then we can definitely organize ourselves quite well.
Hmm.
Oh, I, I just chat with him, and I say that I'm in Waterloo,
and when I'm in Canada I just [unknown] [unknown] really miss you guys, I say,
and they say, really? I say, you see, even you could hardly imagine how much I'll miss you, because I've compared our church events over there.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
He said, when you get back, can you organize some?
I said that I, as a person, uh, ca n't quite believe it, you know? I did n't mean I'm really devout.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
So if I'm, um, very devout, I will just, um,
I am very devout now following you guys, I am just very devout just believed. Following other people, I am also just quite muddleheaded.
Uh-huh.
[laugh] Hmm, yes, you see, had I not said last time, you still keep saying they were whatever, and really it was like that, you were just
It seems they urged you to believe, and after you believed there would be no one who took any notice of you. That's what it's like. Before you believe, they keep on coming to your home,
Yes.
Really
Yes.
So - called [unknown] visits, and whatnot, whatnot, it's like they also specially give you some time to study, ah, it's just like that, and then when you've done it
there is even no one who will take notice of you just to notice you, as if you just had to attend these events by yourself and voluntarily, it seems.
Right.
So,
Moreover, they do n't believe you
Oh, you see, how nice is that Madame church in that church of ours?
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
The one in Waterloo, I mean.
But she does n't have time to organize for everyone to go to this event and that event.
She is just, gosh, anyway
as busy as hell.
Yes. She actually has a lot of things to take care of, and then she also [unknown] she is also from Hong Kong, and probably does n't really understand people from the Mainland either, I think, right.
Your see, over here, this
also
understand, whether you have [unknown] contact with these people.
It means if you have a problem, she'll definitely help you, but, that is to say, it seems she ca n't really make friends with you -- that's just what it's like.
Right.
Yes, right.
Oh, that's just what it's like.
You see, after I went back for fun this time,
once they hear I've come back, buzz every evening they phone, just like that.
It's so lively, after I get back.
OK! So spend more time over there then, and you still think of coming back. [laugh]
No, it's too hot to stay over here.
People all go to work every day. You know people all go to work in the daytime, and no one is [unknown] paying attention to me.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Oh, just the weekend and in the evenings,
Uh-huh.
Yes.
During the day you're just cooped up at home.
Oh! Ha! Go over there, hey, OK, let's talk about it next time.
Hmm.
OK. You get on with your work.
OK. Never mind, OK.
Oh, right.
That, have n't you gone to take another look at that downstairs room of my building?
How can I go, do you think? What is there for me to go and see?% er [unknown] [unknown] [laugh]
Oh.
Yes, there's no need to take a look.
Right, so forget it.
They'll tell you if there is a letter. I just pasted that number of yours up on the wall of my home.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Right. Tell them I said if you, you get a letter, and they know Little Wang.
Uh-huh.
I say that if there is a letter, you just call this there is one called, surnamed.
Uh-huh.

ah
no no no HANG UP which means it's ok it's approved

oh
right
and then
um
we also
isn't that I told you we bought a car last two days
ah
returned the car and bought another one
this is not
did you buy this from DEALER right
for personal use then you should get it returned
it's fixed but the repairing is well you can't tell the difference
oh
anyway just later feel like it's still
generally they said if the car has crashed it would not be good later anyway just not good so we returned it later and bought a new one
ah
to buy a new one or an old one
er bought one car
CAMRY of nineteen eighty-nine
ah
and then four thousands and eight hundreds
oh
ah he has to talk to you about the experience of buying car
ah
hello
eh tell me something about it hmm if it's important I'll buy too
let me tell you this buying car thing the key is the person you buy from who is this owner
ah
ah
oh
this is important
ah
er
let me tell you if you encounter the people from Middle East
um
don't buy it from him
oh
er because he always he say you for example you ask him he isn't the DEALER
um
but he just he intents to he actually he is the DEALER
oh
he comes to buy the car just drive the car back and forth selling car or some of them he gives you
er decorate the outside let me tell you now er this DEALER the car was crashed before he can fix it for you
um
er BODY WORK can make one exactly the same as the new one for you
oh
oh
eh er so for just someone from Middle East or Pakistan
um
and Indian hmm though he won't lie to you but he's stingy you'd better not buy his car
oh
er it's best to buy one from Japanese
really
recently I Taiwanese are not necessarily very very it depends on whom you've run into ah
right Taiwanese just depends on individuals
from Taiwanese sometimes it's cheap sometimes not just for Japanese they do offer low price because you see my classmate
yes
oh
just one of upperclassmen this time
ah
went to Detroit on purpose he works in IOWA and drives for more than ten hours to Detroit to
um
just with my supervisor's
um
friend
ah
there in Detroit many Japanese often move away and they're reluctant to put an advertisement ah so sell cars at low price but it turned out that amid this the cars have changed hands for several times
um
ah
then to my supervisor's friend he then sell again to
this Zhu Jian huh just the upperclassman prior to our class
ah
isn't he working in IOWA huh he just brought several guys over there and drove there for the car
um
ah
and it's still cheaper
ah
you see this time the car I bought is expensive actually I lose money on this just I just bought this at the RETAIL price not the WHOLE SALE price
ah
oh
but we here we have no here they're just expensive
ah
I besides this this batch of people from new England are conservative and very um frugal
ah
er this Yankee hmm people here are called as Yankee just just this means they're conservative frugal what shrewd ah these people
oh when did they come from
anyway all are very conservative
oh also Europe
all are old immigrants
oh
you see the life in New York is very fast it has been said that in Boston it's very slow anyway
oh
er
yes you just block it also to purchase in January might
be cheaper of course it depends difficult to tell er best be
um
the one left he sometimes he wouldn't even advertise it he sometimes for example advertise on this IPS
um
he just stick a piece of paper himself
um
or in the student center if you are free you just check it
yes I can have a look of it properly in the winter break
and not only this sometimes on it on it a lot of things for sale is very I only found out now well for example selling the radar of this car
um
like me I do need to buy a radar because I have been caught three times this year
oh you need it I know you drive very fast
uh yes this radar is actually very cheap at there only a little more than forty bucks at our place here
just the sample which is sold for half the price still needs more than fifty
ah
oh
usually this costs more than a hundred er also things like machines when these Japanese people are leaving they would sell a lot of things you just watch for it
ah
ah
ah
then you see you could if you think it's suitable you just buy it
um
includes that thing the wireless phone
um
just the one with recording and wireless phone you will need it for job hunting in the future therefore if you encountered this kind of thing you just hurry up and buy it
ah
oh
yes
they but best to watch for the Japanese
ah
er South Korean I don't really know but the South Korean actually are the richest
oh
uh they are the richest they usual buy cars of famous brands which would cost forty to fifty thousand
oh
right exactly from this Japanese guy
hi Tan Yan

after Jiji gets a little bigger he could just help you TAKE CARE of his BROTHER this this this kind of
now from dawn to dusk he says can I hold him or not can I feed him milk or not feed him
um
um he is more than a hindrance than a help
let me tell you with with a younger kid well the older kid of yours he
naturally would be a little more thoughtful compare compare compare to those who don't just would be
um
no matter how little the kid is would be a bit more thoughtful really
um would
he naturally ha would have a sense of responsibility I'm telling you
yes
once he gets even older ha would be more like that how old is Jiji now should should be four years old
already five years old
um
people people ask me a most most well what is the QUESTION that surprises me the most guess what it is
UH-HUH
he said am I that older brother or not FOREVER

well what to do then
then
professional
ah
do you do something professional or do you do
er working on the profession she is the one working on the profession but she's not working on this profession of the US
ah something professional

but now because it's winter you know
UH-HUH
there's not much work in winter still working as a PART TIME temporarily you know
UH-HUH UH-HUH
so
it doesn't matter it's good to make the first step
yes it is
they said wait for her to get familiar with this environment and this this system then when the spring begins in next year probably would give her
transfer to FULL TIME for her
ah
I said ok ok ok put the hand in first because it's so hard to find it in our neighborhood
yeah having it's good to have a job first then you're not so lonely
yeah yeah yeah well Tan Yan at that time was also like this making me so eager to hurry up to come here
well also good to work at a restaurant where are you going
dispatched to don't don't be so vexed all day long fuck it's
yes yes yes
it seems we can't find it's like we let her not be able to find a job
yes yes yes the two of us do speak the same language yes yes yes
yes
eh having having a common language having a common language so
so
ah I still have a few months of HARD TIME
always fucking make fun of me shit I can't do anything about it
now fortunately I had found something for her to do anyway this this
well you hurry up and buy hurry up and buy a house
we prepare to buy it next year because now I am still PAY for a car you know
ah
my car would be PAY off at the end of this year later the next year
isn't this car not related just PAY it slowly
ah
oh my god
I do want to PAY it off first then then I would buy the house later
alas right now er
now the interest is pretty low
really
even lower than that when I took out the loan
yes yes seven-ish right
now it's seven-ish over here
yours is seven point five I check it from here
I check it from here it seems that it's a little more than seven point three when I when I took out the loan
really
for thirty years it can reach a little more than seven point five even a little more than seven point six
oh
right you are going to repay the loan for thirty years right
oh oh
we have no idea now
UH-HUH
because it has to depend on the house price because now we haven't decided how big of the house we want to buy
UH-HUH
then if it's expensive for sure it has to take thirty years it can't be PAY off in short term
if it's it's over one hundred thousands over one hundred thousands over one hundred thousands
oh my god
you also want to PAY it off
now just forget to PAY it off
why PAY it off wow
this this this this
can't PAY off
don't consider to PAY it off I don't know the house quotations at your place
here our interest is increasing what's it like for an increasing interest here our interest is increasing so I I will never put the money into
invest it all in this this house
the housing ratio right
oh
because it won't increase it's better to buy buy something else
such as stock to buy other MUTUAL FUND
yes yes yes yes yes
yes yes yes
it will increase a percentage of one ten percent more or less per year
yes yes yes
for your house it won't increase you are just just going to consuming it and that's all
yes yes yes yes yes just have PAY in this way on time that's it right
yes PAY like this on time you
but they said the INTEREST you put in would probably be more
ah
the INTEREST put in would be more
the interest
normally it's twenty percent that's how it works after PAY off the twenty percent
yes yes
your DOWN PAYMENT PAY twenty percent it won't CHARGE your what's the name of it
it is MORGAGED INSURANCE
it is that mortgage INSURANCE
um
loan INSURANCE in this case you don't don't have to PAY that INSURANCE FEE in this way
you can save the money
an amount of money
oh
er about the rest the interest this interest anyway it's given
it's duty free can it's tax deductible
yes yes
so
yes yes
you can't er you have to you prepare prepare to buy them all
ah
buy CASH
wow
yes I you scared me I am
when you go to buy the house say
I buy CASH wow that person
only the owner of Chinese restaurant in New York can do it we are absolutely not allowed
yes immediately it would be instantly you don't have to say it it would be gone the next day cool
um
can make more money right
prepare prepare
at least it's not CASH have to be paid off in five years isn't it
currently I am considering of either the fifteenth years or the thirty years
because there's an interest rate of below fifteen years here
UH-HUH
including the fifteenth year it's one interest rate and then another interest rate for the fifteenth year to the thirtieth year
yes there's a ten
is that right
yes yes yes
but it's up to you if you are willing to talk or not if you don't then usually
I
who knows it's seven years would run away if it's five years
then you don't have to get the loan
it's not necessarily to loan for short period of time right
no it's not
I don't know it's up to you
um
it means now my loan is for seven years
um
I am seven years count it as thirty years
loan for seven years
oh
no no how should I say it
it's named
seven years ago
seven year a period of time is
an INTEREST RATE
oh
then what
after seven years
it's another one which is based on that price at that time
the INTEREST RATE at that time he added it for you
count your twenty-three years is at that time would adjust for you again
but this one is
lower
oh
comparing this with that fifteen years and thirty years
um
lower
because I am wondering
I may not stay here
over seven years
over seven years
yes
at least I have to over seven years stay here over seven
maybe I would still get a new house
oh
because if you are getting a new house you have to renew all have to get another mortgage
oh which means this house is completely sold right
yes sell this house then go to
build a house or buy a house WHATEVER
anyway I mean
it means after seven years you won't have this interest rate problem right
you just have to once after you sold it you can pay off the money at once
yes yes yes
oh
that's right
yes yes yes
you just have to TAKE CARE of these seven years right
yes within seven years I in this way I can
TAKE TAKE this kind of ADVANTAGE from its relatively low interest rate interest rate
yes yes yes yes yes yes oh this one I still don't understand about this
this is actually a GOOD IDEA then we can
no you have you have this one it has serval years there's five-year
UH-HUH
ten-year
UH-HUH
seven-year
UH-HUH
so it's up to you probably you
your PLAN is
how much is it for example if you stay there
yes yes yes
yes you just
er just have to set to PAY off it in fifteen years that's it
oh
if you say you don't want to stay I I think it's not
unlikely to stay
stay forever in the same fucking place
ah it's you asked the people of the bank they told you about this right
that's right
the bank the bank if we go to ask about it the bank they would know all of these right
in the bank it has this kind of
yes exactly
he would tell you how how many kinds of
fifteen years and this thirty years this is named
this is general
normally this kind is most common
there's one more it's seven
it's named named ARM A R M
it's named
named named this kind this kind is named A BALLOON it's also
another name of it is BALLOON it's like that
that that
same as a ball
same as a ball same as BALLOON that BALLOON
um
UH-HUH
BALLOON this loan it is
BALLOON
FIX
front
the interest rate would be lower if I got a five year loan
yes yes yes
yes yes yes
then what
for the remaining twenty five years it will then JUSTIFY again
no no many of these now
this is called PRODUCT it's all kinds of
UH-HUH
all kinds of let people meet all kinds of needs
but most people are still
many people spent thirty years of their life
UH-HUH
that is to say they seem not to WORRY the things after five years or seven years
then again then again then again
go to adjust again
then think about this issue again
but I just think that we then
two children now if
if this JIMMY grew up in seven years later
then he would be a
yes
so I think it might be
that is to change another house or just
if I still want to stay here then why
then then go to UPGRADE the house a little bit right
yes yes yes
er SENIOR damned er then just vagrant huh well
ah
yes yes this one you mentioned is important we still
haven't heard of it we only know there're fifteen years and thirty years because we are
we asked about it casually they didn't talk to us in details
oh it's you said this kind of BALLOON this kind is able to FIX the first few years
and then ADJUST again in the last few years
um
according to its then
adjust the interest rate
that interest rate and adjusted for me and after that it's settled ah
oh
oh
adjusted for me to um then just for example
OK for the next twenty three years
just follow this interest rate
PAY on this interest rate
ah just follow this and PAY you can PAY if you want to PAY
um
either you PAY or you pay off
UH-HUH
it works like this hmm
yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
pay off then you
that
right I I was thinking in seven years I I had no idea whether I would be staying somewhere and doing
OU ah we this
UH-HUH
OU current recent just you
recently we
do you agree huh
oh
UH-HUH
you eh Li Li Tiesheng you know him huh he's already got a JOB
hello
oh really where is it
he's in SAN JOSE ah
oh found a job in San Jose
right on he's already
moved over he's in one company and seems to be working on this
huh ELECTRIC EIGINEER um still works on his that that stuff
ah still doing ENGINEER
that's right
yeah he came out at last I thought
found it as a PH D
ah
found it as a PH D
oh
I think so
oh
I originally wanted to see I help I thought he is a veteran and hasn't found it yet I wanted to help him
oh that's also not bad
right we at this time he's the oldest
yeah helped him to see if we can get one for him here and then he I I sent that I said
haha can you send your RESUME to me so that I could ask it for you
then he said whoops I've already
gotten a JOB
oh
well that solved the problem
oh that's not bad ha
that's right
then seems at OU all the old people have left
that's right
now it depends on Shen Jingguo ha do you have any news of him
not yet
he he retreated to New York
yeah he said
he told me last time that
ah I'll call you when I get a JOB I said you should call us even if you didn't get JOB this this
right I just said if you didn't find a JOB could also find a
he he said he was embarrassed that is to say fuck
yes yes
yes he's kind of that seems
jobless vagrant you were with your these guys

er like unwilling to socialize ha
er
er Miu Liang got to a new job again do you know

Miu Liang
Miao Liang changed job again
Miu Liang now has gone to Washington

oh
he the former one he stopped working there he hopped again to Washington found another JOB went to work in Washington
now working in EPA
wow then he
um
the the money he earned may
offset this these depend on the use
yes
yes
yes yes yes
it's a big expense
the consumption is big
right but
UH-HUH
yes
like us now
Bai Yang that day gave me one she
eh have you got an E-MAIL nope ah
I I am still that account of OU

BYE BYE
BYE
BYE
HELLO
ah
sigh
what it starts recording now
sure sure
ha I think he is going to say something
damn it
shit I should tell you show you
ah
it is all right
but I suddenly wonder you already finished hanging that would be hard to me just now I wanted to put down I suddenly wondered it's not right
no no
it is fine it is fine
oh really that how's your debate
it is all right
will answer it tomorrow
no problem because you I think you should've prepared better than Li Hongguang those people
cough
anyway
Li Hongguang it is said shit what the fuck wrong with the essay
seems like not satisfied with the work shit
are you
who who knows I heard someone said it's said by Wang Yi
who say that
just as Wang Yi said
Wang Yi
um
just say that Feng Yan
classmates
right
isn't his name Wang Yi
who knows I just called him Wang
is it Wang Yi or Wang Yi
are we wrong about it
me too
no no no I said it wrong I called it wrong I should say Wang
ah
it is Wang Yi right
right Wang Yi right
I thought we were wrong
should be called Yi called Yi
ah
that one I just er cut the cackle because you still have the defense tomorrow
it is fine it is fine it is fine
that one you know now I am just deciding should I but GATEWAY or DIGITAL after all because at that time wasn't Liu Dalin say he has one there
ah
GAYEWAY one of the reason he returned it because of the problem of fan
em em em
just the whir sound you can feel it are you that incredible
my I think there are still some noises but
I don't know either
I feel like it is bigger than the computer room but
because in the computer room it is at
the school that empty empty
there are noises from the ventilating and then there are many machines therefore
can't feel it
perhaps
maybe yourself could not feel it
oh
like this anyway if you put the machine at home you can feel you can actually hear the sound from it
oh
vroom vroom
because Liu Dalin he said compare with the unit he thinks the sound is large
compare to that thing
and unit
oh the sound of the unit right
besides now
right just his unit is using machine
ah
because there's another question that is
that one you know that one
you you bring me that thing
that one
that is everyone has reflected the service of GATEWAY isn't good
it is like this GATEWAY recently it
er it it it is that is to say that your phone call time
ah
it is pretty long
it is that they make a statistics that
it means that you
you
from you for example you you have a problem your computer has a problem for example a software you install always fail to run
ah
ah
ah
when you want to call its the TECHNICAL SERVICE
ah
usually it will take a long time to wait
oh
it this is because it is
but I think many companies are like this
all are busy now
no no no no
GATEWAY is longer because it is like this it says because
it develops so fast
ah
many users purchase it but cannot follow its after-sale service cannot match it
ah
therefore it is it is it is hard to call them
and it will take long time to be on hold even they pick up the phone
yours has VOICE
is it VOICE VIEW you know AND FULL DUPLEX SPEAKER PHONE
um you are talking about computers
er right
you bought it
er
you know you know PHONE
SPEAKER PHONE I don't care of the others anyway are there
SPEAKER PHONE
do you have SPEAKER PHONE
mine mine doesn't have it
mine is just a that multimedia that SPEAKER TWO two SPEAKER but no SPEAKER PHONE
you mean just two that speaker
two speakers that is when you have to PLAY that MUSIC it that
oh
oh
there're
oh yes
does this have ANSWER MACHINE
er mine has ANSWER MACHINE and FAX
but mine is fourteen point four
your ANSWER MACHINE that thing can it it it be used on the computer it
when it's on it can be used I I made it once
when you send FAX FAX
just this
when you send FAX or receive you have to always turn it on seems like running
yes yes yes
for for example you you you that one you know
ah
that's wasting power you always running it
ah
it's fine with the battery actually but just your machine
yes
no machine is also should be practical some people said shouldn't turn it off once it's on there's a version of this
yes
but some people say
one day that is for example you you only switch it on and off once a day
ah
it's better in this way
oh
because he said this of battery
this machine this loss of device generally are that it
ah
ah
under the switch condition
ah
compare to this damage of machine is bigger
oh
when it's actually running this damage it would be compare to it
but it's wasting power
yeah yeah that is anyway
how many DRIVE BAYS of that
what BASE
er DRIVE BAYS
B A Y S
BAYS
er DRIVE oh I don't know about that mine is not the TOWER mine is that flat one like the TOP DESK
then you mean TOWER BAY is better and easier to expand or something like that
it is like this for the TOWER when I buy GATEWAY he says
I well the advertising fee for him is that kind
um
like DESKTOP
oh
but I need to pay fifty more if I want to buy TOWER CASE
oh
so I did not buy it
but it seems that we still think TOWER CASE is better
oh
normally
you think it's quite good to use
I am okay with it anyway it doesn't have any problems
you are just
but because it is still expensive anyway
let me tell you DIGITAL isn't that GATEWAY Gang Jiang
um
yeah because yeah now computers they are all reducing the price
De Jia you see let me spell it for you
ah
it's on hundred and thirty-three
er
uh huh yeah
PENTIUM it's sixteen trillions
um
two hundred and fifty-six K CACHE and then one hundred one point six two GB
um
and then the others are also this fifteen inches MONITOR
um
now it's selling for twenty-seven hundred and ninety-nine fuck it
er ten how much
twenty-seven hundred and ninety-nine
no fifteen-inch MONITOR
yes
two thousand nine seven hundred
twenty-seven hundred and ninety-nine equals to two thousands and eight hundred
oh
but no you have to consider there there are some aspects
ah
the first one is the size of your ROM how big the V ROM is
er just that pattern that V ROM
yeah it is called
two two trillions double
two-megabyte ROM er it is fine some are one-megabyte some are two
right
right
right right it's mainly because can be quickly adjusting of pattern right
and then
one kind of its COLOR such as the one for graphics display
and the speed will certainly be affected
that is also includes different COLOUR kinds
yeah yeah the change of the COLOR
oh
that's why you see now this one is much cheaper
er and then is five
ah
others called
you know WINDOW ninety-five MS OFFICE ninety-five whatever these are all given in CD ROM
um um
um
yours are also CD ROM right
yes
my yeah yeah
oh
um that's that's fine anyway you of course you bought it at that time this can't be compared
yes yes yes
that is
just let me tell you just these two days because last two days that one mailed to me was still quite expensive
computer you
um
just today that DIGITAL that Korean gave Feng Yan
take it over here this one
um
quotation
um
now it's also competing for me and then it's this DIGITAL because they can be cheaper for twenty percents
um
but DIGITAL
anyway they are saying that DIGITAL has very good quality
ah
because job-hopping people in many companies do the comparison
um
because DIGITAL has always been like the Japanese emphasizing the quality it is said that the earthquake in San Francisco did not cause a damage to DIGITAL
um
ah ah
but who knows anyway so now I am thinking about it but
ah ah ah
the DIGITAL it may be the PRELOADED WINDOW ninety five
which means it may not come with a CD ROM I need to think about it
oh then
what if nine five doesn't cost too much
ah
because nine five doesn't cost too much money
oh
because nine five is just
but for OFFICE MS OFFICE
oh I don't know about OFFICE it nine five anyway is just
nine ninety five only costs eighty yuan and more
yes yes
seventy or eighty yuan
yeah just like this
oh
no because you you for the DIGITAL you can get twenty percent off that is a lot
ah
you can almost save a hundred
no but after price reduction it is as cheap as GATEWAY
oh oh oh I see
then DIGITAL is always expensive because its quality is more
yeah yeah those those those such as COMPAQ are all very expensive that that doesn't worth
damn it
damn it
er the then how about your defense
what two o'clock tomorrow anyway
I I know
it is one o'clock for Li Hongguang
they are saying that you went to to Chicago after defense
me here
oh I truly want to go but what's the situation now both RESUME and that are not sent to me
you want a job there
no no no it it's not
ah
at that time I how did you you hear it as
I went to Chicago to include went to Chicago to attend the meeting of that AUTO FAG
oh you also there
and then its INGSO and BROCO he needed to go three places
ah
and then at that time I said I really wanted to go
ah
I just went it was like this just saying
it was about only two days
oh
I would go out on Sunday afternoon hmm oh right
two days and a half would come back on Tuesday night anyway
then how about your job hunting just looking for jobs near there
the no no no no no
ah
so I'm hesitating now I said because I I I didn't even send a single letter yet
yesterday that to Xiao Sheng of course ask Feng Yan Feng Yan
ah
because yesterday we we I asked Xiao Sheng to buy an ANSWER MACHINE or something like that
yeah right you must have this
and brought
that's right so because I I plan to begin to send in batches the day after tomorrow after tomorrow's debate
um
for sending EMAIL and RESUME and the like it needs this
right
at least now you have the machine you can search for it through EMAIL
yes yes
now I am buying the machine is also for FAX
right actually if you have that it'll be very convenient for me now to
yes
also also also read things like recruitment advertising at home
for many of them you can just send an EMAIL and it'll do the work
yes yes
well therefore just need to write letters
well then what should you do for the signature you need the COVER LETTER
sign right
yes
%null
then EMAIL could not sign on it
can we sign on it
then what are you going to do with the COVER LETTER that you don't have signature on it
then probably EMAIL could not work
you cannot do anything when you are using EMAIL
maybe
we are not talking about
you FAX then you write it down and then you can FAX there
but we cannot do it when we are using computers to FAX it
it can
FAX is doable
ah
possible
can it scan
no
well you you are going to add you are going to buy computers that MODEM it has the FAX function
and then you you can set the PRINTER as FAX
well you you you for example you can write a COVER LETTER and RESUME in the WORD
right
yes
and then you PRINT
it will PRINT to your FAX
via the MODEM actually the FAX MODEM and the it will be sent out
yes
I mean still it cannot through the paper we print and then it doesn't like the normal FAX MACHINE that you can sent the paper
and it scans it and sends it out
oh then you don't need it
you
you just what you want to write you
I know that is why I said you cannot sign on it because of that
er sign
FAX
you can only edit it on computer and then you PRINT it out right
yes yes
yeah I think now
should it be such formal EMAIL could not get signature
yes yes yes
then then he's driven mad Bai Lai wants a signature isn't he
yes
you need to find a job you need to attend the exam if you want you just come and do the searching here
ah
oh
I I because recently I'm busy with this and then take a look at it
well now you
I I want to start with that
I'll send out a batch first to see what happens
yes
if it doesn't work then go to your place
yes
how about
it's okay
no problem
no no I mean I was thinking that Xiao Sun will go with Wang Yi
ah
then what are you going to do if you get a job
oops yeah she's going there then
they are freaking registered I was just wondering you two
but they always say that I think I I'm not certain about that I might find it in January February or perhaps March
that is not sure you you are still fast
certainly
now it's not that easy to look for
besides it is easy for me I just changed the RESUME to that
what it changed to
it's that factory
that changed the three-year working experience of HAID to factory
ah ah
so this this this time so there was an INTERVIEW last time
this one
oh
oh how many are there at once INTERVIEW
of course at least just begin to give me INTERVIEW it's official and it used to be introduced by others
yeah why are you you
why do you have this IDEA
I'm fucking learning the lesson from the bitter experience I'm telling you that I was watching the computer and came up with an idea that day I said take it or leave it
ah
and here in our place to be honest it's hard to find a MANUFACTURE
ah
it's that it's easy to find a computer after all
ah
for MANUFACTURE when it comes to JOB FAIR there are a lot of people waiting in line each time then I feel it has been saturated yes
MANUFACTURING
right and people inside DIGITAL also told Feng Yan that now basically the Americans were moving all their directions to Asia
so so it's not right for me to learn MANUFACTURE now
ah
right anyway well ah anyway but just give it a try first taking one step and looking around before taking another
ah
shit this is
so you what about you is there any news about that
you resigned in December didn't you
as a result it felt quite good in last last INTERVIEW they asked me questions about optics mine
ah
were all CORRECT
ah
and damn it once he saw that I filled F ONE in my form
he was not okay with that because the boss enjoined him that every single person of this kind
was not acceptable
oh
that's because they used to deal with that for a Chinese and felt it quite troublesome
oh
shit
this
oh my god
damn it
cough
this is how it goes
that
that that's right then you when did you buy it
do you have to buy a computer recently
I might have to make a decision tomorrow after all I have to choose from these two
oh
ah
yes I'm now thinking about it thinking about it damn it
the one you said worth of two hundred and seventy two thousand and seven hundred how big is that hard disk
one point six
oh that's cool one point six is cool
one point six two
yeah and I what you bought is one hundred PENTIMUM it's one hundred and thirty thirty
mine is one hundred and twenty
I guess why did the price drop suddenly in these two days
just two two a few days away
um
because I read the World Journal a couple of days ago
um
PENTIUM two hundred has just come onto the market
oh
it's said that the graphics are extremely fast
um
that is that
yes it is
as soon as you yours comes out this one goes down in price it's all like this
oh yes
damn it
I was then you know I wanted to buy that with a hundred
but for one hundred it it's that
alas which one did you actually buy
mine is one hundred and twenty
ah one hundred and twenty I thought you bought one hundred
yes
no mine is one hundred and twenty I was that when one hundred and twenty came out
oh
when I bought it one three three was just released a few days
ouch
the price of it didn't fall much but for hundred it was not equipped with an additional what's that
CACHE
ah
by the way do you have CACHE now the CACHE in two hundred and fifty six K
usually there be but DIGITAL I didn't find it's listed here so I tomorrow
but let me tell you that
GATEWAY
ah
it looks like under a hundred I don't know why it doesn't give it anyway
I think they're strange too
it's unavailable for those inferior to hundred what does it mean
one one hundred it's just below P one hundred
ah that is there is no two hundred and fifty six K
yeah yeah he said there is no need to say what are they doing ouch their sales services or that
ah
those who call say differently from those who receive guests
so it's not clear either
oh
ah that is someone said that
that is
of course that's important I know that
he said CACHE is very important at least has to be two hundred on all the books I read
yeah it's that's it
two hundred and fifty-five K or better to be more than five hundred
um
yeah five hundred
but GATEWAY over there he said there's none
um ah
so
that
alas what did I want to say just now
nothing seems to be wrong
ah
that's fine
it's all over
ah
that that someone
your SPEAKER comes with it isn't it
er just two speakers
know if SPEAKERPHONE is the trumpet
no
no I just said when you PLAY that multimedia
multimedia
let's say a CD
oh
ah
did you buy it separately
no no no I just
right seems there's none of this inside there and then I matched it
it was included in the price
right at that time just said on it that one that one that one called you know it's not on the advertisement it gave me
oh
oh
and then it can just said whatever you you want you just let him put it on at that time
yes
yeah yeah yeah yeah ah that
right I added it up
I'm going to buy one hundred and twenty too
one hundred and twenty
PENTIUM one hundred and twenty because I think it's not much different
ah
right right it's also like this practically
it's said just ten percent or so
it's like this right
then I'm going to get a monitor I don't want to buy a big one either just buy a fifteen inch
but
otherwise I I can't afford it now
ah
Liu Zhen
ah
now
yes you told me that
no
sue you now school had changed them all to seventeen inches
under the HALL they are all seventeen inches MONITOR
yes
yes
Rong also bought a seventeen inches lately
is he going to buy a computer recently
bought it
he doesn't
didn't he have it why did he buy another one
how many
no no just that one have have have to isn't that have to make that project with that Air Force base
oh
they bought a that one hundred one three three
but I think in our own house are we going to use that many graphs or engineering
that's right that's true actually
Liu Dalin also said that he think it was better to buy a fifteen inch one that is to say
ouch the eyes won't be tired so
right that's right actually anyway you just have a look
and it can save three hundred
er now it's three hundred
it's just three hundred in difference between seventeen inch and fifteen inch
three hundred extra
right
I right at that time I also asked him to pay more to me two hundred something two hundred and sixty or how much I forgot
two hundred and sixty for twenty seven inch
right just it's different with each factory some are expensive some are some are cheap each factory
um
yeah I know that's true is that yours two hundred and sixty
right around two
seventeen inch
%null
it's impossible
I
how much was it let me think about it
I have asked him also
anyway it's not three hundred
not three hundred certainly it's less than three hundred it's two hundred
ah look there is no much difference between these two is it
that is that one you add another based on the fifteen inches
ah yeah yeah yeah that GATEWAY for me only added one hundred and ninety now
are you
he's going to change a seventeen inch one yeah I asked him already
ah
he just added it to me so GATEWAY now GATEWAY has fallen sharply in price
ah
no
I think so of course you you it's for your reference only
yes
how is your big screen you open many WINDOW
you don't have to go change it all the time
yes
you now I realized if yours is fifteen inches
ah
your that WORD that one basically has two-thirds only two-thirds of it is usable
one-thirds of it is BUTTON
if you have to
it's eight inch
just those that MANUAL you know that one
ah
that one just
oh yeah yeah yeah TOOLBAR
TOOLBAR those things took over at least one-thirds of it
yes
and then you only has two-thirds of space
and then you you add another one that HELP has many new ON LINE HELP softwares
ah ah
you that is not buying the softwares without manuals at all
about ON LINE HELP if you you watch it if your your screen is big enough
it would show HELP on this side you could do other things on another side that's what I thought of course that is
yes
yes
it's indeed quite big this was put in my home sometimes I also think it's quite big
just take too much space the big screen at the back in fact doesn't seems special actually it's just a large piece of it at the back
yes
ah
half an hour how long is it
now
oh yeah it it will tell
ah ah
do you have anything with Feng Yan
no just Xiao Sheng would like to ask about the ANSWER MACHINE she would talk to Feng Yan
ah ok ok you let you just let them
ah good
ah
that's just too short
ah
hello Feng Yan
ah
only only left a few minutes for us just
I think it's tough enough I have to tell you that is I want to
come on just talk if there is no much phone bill then I'll call you back later it's all right
oh I'm just talking with you on the matter of ANSWER MACHINE
ah
it's what you bought is the TAPE type right
well what is yeah yeah it's TAPE's
it's just
oh TAPE it's just whether what you own is one TAPE SINGLE TAPE or DOUBLE TAPE
the one
single type what you think
um
just what do you think of it is it working well
it's pretty good
pretty good its TAPE is just the TAPE that is quite small
yes yes yes
do you think it's enough
that's enough it takes long time just go through it once because nobody left MESSAGE to you all day long
ah
I for me I bought one
ah
it's just what I bought is a FULLY DIGITAL one
later I it had some defect that is
ah
its time is too short it that is to say it only has four minutes in total
ah
forty minutes four minutes it also said
typically it can't keep that many MESSAGE for one day so four minutes provided that
ah
it's a consecutive four-minutes it'll be okay but it is it will cut automatically for you
ah
cutting into thirty-seconds for each thirty-seconds for each for each only up to thirty seconds for each person
oh
oh
and then it's that if one person such as you uses only a few seconds then the person after you can not use what you left
ah
it's like that so it's very it feels too short and is afraid that it will automatically cut off to make people hang up when they leave leave leave a little bit more messages
ah
ah
so that I might have to change one now I'm considering because I saw that what it sold contained that SINGLE TAPE type and the DOUBLE TAPE type
um
um
um
and then I didn't know which to buy and I want to ask for your suggestions on this
alas I don't know it either because I bought it where is that at that time
ah
I bought it in BUZ
oh
so half the price that's the only one I was then just bought it then and I had nothing to choose from
oh
the one you bought is that DIGITAL more expensive
it isn't I have seen that some TAPE are similar to it at that time I chose it because it did not need TAPE I think it would be convenient
are you
ah
additionally you bought ANSWER MACHINE
yeah I did not buy it in packages
ah
I bought a phone and then an ANSWER MACHINE
ah ah ah
then you bought a package of it
yes
oh
and then I I was thinking that I am so
at last I found out its disadvantage and it it is not good
oh
and then I asked others to try it speak two more sentences in thirty seconds and it cut off before finished
ah
ah
isn't it well I don't know that
ah
then I even
but they said TAPE just worry about you do that just that
is it going rewind back and forth
ah
anyway that is to say maybe it is
over a period of time that is to say there is no damage anywhere else maybe the thing that controls the TAPE is going to be damaged because it needs to be used back and forth
rewind for a while then record again or something
that is to say
yeah just that it's more likely they that is to say they're more likely to be damaged
er well it is like our recording machine
yes yes
just need to pay attention on the head that it will bu unclear as time goes by
yes
yeah I'm not sure about it anyway I think two or three years is enough anyway
yeah anyway it
we'll see
it is not expensive and it can last for two or three years it is okay if we need to change it in two or three years
so how much did you pay for that ANSWER MACHINE
I bought it for thirty four yuan and more
ah thirty four yuan
ah
he he said he just told me about the advantages like you don't need the TAPE you don't have to deal with TAPE or something like that
um
um
he also said that it will clear all the time
ah that's right I'm sure DIGITAL should be clearer than TAPE
ah
yes
yes
and then I just bought when hearing his promotion I had test it and it was okay and I said the advantages are all good
um
ah
ah
ah
and then I bought it and felt it was too short and it will cut off automatically it is very if it did not cut off then four minutes is also acceptable
ah ah
how many MESSAGE you are going to receive from others in one day
ah
ah
well it seems that I need to change for another one
oh then
I don't know then you change a TAPE or else I don't know either anyway I can still use TAPE now
I think it is good
yeah I also think it's quite clear
ah
yeah for others I don't think so
ah
ah then at that time
hello
ah
I have something urgent with Bai Yong
ok then you Bai Yong comes over soon Li Guozhang wants to
hello Li Guozhang
hey Bai Yong pay attention to it haha
um
that's your business don't pass it on to anyone else
um
er that's just Luo Gang he got hepatitis
oh
I know
you you how did you know that
I already know
so does our group all know that
I don't know because I I just does everyone about it except me
did you hear that from Rong
no no
that one was that day we went to to have fun in Wang Qun's place
them Wang Qun know that
yes
oh
okay that's what I mean that's to say pay attention to it
right I I know
I tell you that another one took it just that day they
does Jian Yinggang know about it
he knows
he knows
I
I just told him
when is it
because I have a good relationship with both of you so I just tell you both but I won't tell others I
um
is it just a moment ago exactly
just two days ago
but just now I saw he was still doing LAB with Luo Gang over there
then he can't do anything about it now they both are in the same fucking group
then how does he in a group
the two of them also only go to that Taiwanese place that they always got invited for dinners
to have leftovers or still still still eat
are you
then but I just went to hand my essay to Rong a moment ago I went to talk to him that you know
then the two of them
I saw them two were doing LAB over there was doing that just now
that's sure the two of them are a group
just doing the experiment
what what
PROJECT
it's a kind of a class is it
right
it's like this
that's nothing we can do it's already in the same group this thing you so let me tell you you just need to pay attention
it's okay
I thought you didn't know let me tell you anyway that is especially wash your hands first before eating whatever
I I know I know
yes
don't need the others
yes
it's okay
no nothing else you let Feng Yang talks to Xiao Suner
ok
ah
hello
ah
hello
ah
feel like right now the time is still enough for you know
no it would remind you later
ah
it means time's almost up
oh
right so it doesn't matter you can say it as you want now you off it means nothing anyway
yes
ah
it's okay
you that one also can't be you know
it's okay
then I am going to ask you that time you went to Florida anyway if it's off you just let it be it doesn't matter anyway
ok nothing
that means it is morning that is in the morning usually wake up in the morning
that is organize you to go out and then play for an entire day and come back at night is it right
yes
that is to say
morning you have breakfasts and dinners at someone else's places and you bring something for lunch yourself is it right or do you buy it
that is
no it's not it's different that is
we are in the KATHY'S group that old man is specially nice he always you are not asking you
pay more than one hundred yuan in the beginning
ah
and then it just has to go out at noontime everyday he would buy many breads also you know jam and those little stuffs for everyone altogether
oh
just taking finish the noon that it everyone eats together in that way it can save your
isn't it expensive to buy it myself
it just in that way it can save money for you also don't have to pay for it what is inside that one hundred yuan you paid it includes lunch for you
oh
sometimes it would even send you
for example
it would give you send you COUPON
ah
for example give you five yuan that is for example it's time for lunch it gives five yuan for each of you
ah
oh
and then drive you to for example
TACO TACO BELLO or somewhere else
oh
and then each of you takes five yuan to buy
oh
that is that is usually you don't have to pay to have food there to have breakfasts and dinners in that HOST FAMILY sometimes if it's late at night in fact it's also
ah
oh
it's also in a group sometimes drive to whatever restaurants
just drive to that kind of fast food shop to have food there
when do you usually go back at night
um it's different depends on where you go sometimes it's earlier sometimes it's later
at night if you want to for example go to
DISNEY WORLD one night it got so late came back at ten ten o'clock because there's one night to see that
um
laser
um
just that flame or something like that so there's a night was relatively late
ah
oh
yes
and then others
oh
yes
so far so good
now I
asking you right now is more correct just happen we both going to the same place probably it's still that old man or not by the time
it's possible that old man is quite good
oh
it's most worthy going there because he
he just he organized this kind of activity for more than ten years and then also made many friends
ah
for example he goes to DISNEY WORLD SEA WORLD with you he can can get very cheap tickets
um
um
ah
if otherwise for example like we go to DISNEY WORLD by ourselves you have to spend more than thirty yuan to buy a ticket for one day
um
then you think about it you will
can't play too much places
ah
then there's another place we go to a place it's that kind of place
eating while looking down at them it's just like in ancient times
um
ride a horse and then that kind
um
fight each other like that
um
and then you eat here using that kind like the ancient style
eat with the kind of tableware that is very rough but it's not silver neither the iron and then there was a whole chicken
ah
ah
one one small chicken that is a whole chicken
ah
are you
it just just has that kind of original flavor in particular
are you
that that's forty yuan a night if you buy it yourself
oh
then if they were we may as he said get it with more than ten yuan that is to say he helps you get it later
just just with watching and eating right
that's right it's just that whole thing
oh
it's just the circle around you and then just one side that is to say it's just it's just that kind what's it called what's it called
um
er THEATER er RESTAURANT or it's called
RESTAURANT is called THEATER RESTAURANT that is to say you can see while doing that
it's quite fun
ah
and then that's to say you're going to that GROUP anyway you see each one of us paid one hundred or so at that time I forgot
um
ah finally some money was returned to us that is to say each one of us spent one hundred yuan there
ah
that's quite good that one you know when it just distributes the living place is it that just a few people are distributed to one family something like that
yes
basically it is
how many people were in one house at that time
I'm with another girl
ah
two people are in one family
ah
it's also possible that one person lives in one family
ah
it's different because that is to say look at HOST FAMILY some families are big which may accommodate more people
oh
for small faimily usually it might be it can accommodate at least two people together
oh
but I don't know like you and Wang Yi you should contact the old man would it be possible that is to say
you were arranged together I don't know it was well arranged last time
that
just the last time after you went there already distributed it before getting there
yes it was well arranged before you get there afterthat for example you've decided to go to KENSIMIRE and then you would be arranged in individual family and then afterthat it's you who contact that HOST FAMILY
um
that can
oh
they'll call you
that is before going to there he would tell you who's the FAMILY later
yeah that's right then that HOST FAMILY will call you
and then you
oh
yep that's it
oh
yeah if you don't you just talk to the old man but it's different like them they sometimes if they have HOST FAMILY they just expect for example
um
well fine someone from China and find someone from other country they that is to say in this way we can understand different cultures in different countries right if it's always the case that Chinese people get together they sometimes anyway it's different
oh
oh
oh
I don't know how they were arranged
is there a lot of Chinese going to there
yes
ah
there are a lot of Chinese
there are many Chinese no matter where you go for church activities this time is so you know that one you know the Lao Sun's family also applied for it
have they received
I don't know I just received it this afternoon
oh
today I go to
it should be all right alas so his son has returned home hasn't he
no he said
oh he is still there
he must be stunned
do you think they can let me go back
so what should do it's delayed he won't go to school if staying here
they plan to directly probably just go straight to the university in here
just do it here
yes
anyway it's only the grade of TOEFL here
by the time inside the country
that have to pay for it
what pay for what you mean tuition fee
the college fee
then then then nothing we can do it's also self-pay inside the country now
yes exactly
that's still you know compare to here if you can get into the school inside the country that is the tuition fee is still not much
um
but
you so if you plan for long-term it's still worthy because you have to think you are coming over here anyway in the future you are here
that's true actually
English is the major to you over here your English is good
um
yes
yes
in the long-term development for the future it's still beneficial anyway it's
um
yes
also don't know about them
yes
they are also in here that it's still better to be with parents anyway
ah
yes
right if it's able to go there right seems it's quite good to them
last time it was the four of you last time right
yes
this time I heard he said that is
have to be four people from the same school
yes
all right
that I don't know would it take them all because if taking them all there're five people then
it's probably not that strict I don't know then certainly there are other people apply for it
ah
right people certainly certainly there are many that day when that thing came we just looking forward to it for many weeks just always asked that Lao Rui has he come yet
ah
ah
ah
it rang isn't it
not yet
I heard a loud sound
no it would tell you when is it
oh
and then that one seems like that is you want to go to the coldest place to ski or the hottest place that probably means FLORIDA
um
um
all have to send this application out IMMEDIATELY and then we just hurry up at the same day afternoon we both just
um
um
um
that day he asked Wang Yi to call you no just and then we filled up and just just sent it we both put in the same envelop
um
oh
and then that one we both has a NOTE there that is there's a place for us to write
all written distribute with each other together I want to
that probably can give you that you know right
um I think if ignoring him
hello Xiao Qing
hello sister eh you eh you this is well er what is this made from
ah
how about
this is that UPENN
oh did it pay or what's the matter
yes also gave me I got the twenty yuans that sent to me
I'd say otherwise you wouldn't
otherwise I don't have to make this thirty minutes phone call
it's just
oh this still takes thirty more minutes right
er said can be up to thirty minutes I think it doesn't take so long yes
ah can make a call for up to thirty minutes oh okay
I called it from home yesterday but that POUND SIGN of our house wasn't working I don't know why
oh
not WORK later I said simply go to to to that you know to here and make the phone call
this way
oh I said yesterday later when I went back last night you didn't give me a call
um
wait for a long time right
I didn't really wait because I because yesterday I thought of your telling me that anyway
that's fine
um
em maybe when you're back you just give me a call here call my workplace I think you might feel that I isn't it
yes
busy yesterday later just didn't give me a call
um
huh um
that's also true now I also I well for CHRISTMAS also gave me one week off now it's
is it ah then a week of holiday
yes
yes it can let me let me have one week off and then well
then that's pretty good
um
and then like our THANKSGIVING we also don't have to go to work the whole day
is it don't need to go to work as well ha
yes
yes yes
although he said that's why many people of OFFICE won't come at that day
um
um yes many ah yes
he said also that that CHRISTAMS he said it's also the good time that is people would TAKE VACATION on CHRISTAMS
um
ah
yes
also go to CHRISTAMS and then from CHRISTAMS to NEW YEAR DAY CLIENT don't go to work often during that period of time
yes
won't take many CLIENT to here so they
yes just everyone is spending their new year on that period of time once the night on Christmas Day is passed it's the new year so
yes
that's why they have nothing to do
that's why he said that time anyway but I still need to that is if there's anything to do at that time I have to finish all these things before I leave
um
I guess it probably works I would book the ticket first because if book the ticket later it would be particularly difficult to book it for sure
ah
yes yes yes
so
now but seems like now it doesn't have relatively that is even cheaper ticket on sale no ha
now I now this one I bought is three hundreds and fifty-six yuans
three hundred and fifty-six RMB ha
yes it's alright a bit expensive than I used to pay
more or less
um
yes it was around three hundreds three hundred yuans before
that
but now but I actually I can get the cheapest one which is that one you know TWA it's one hundred over two hundred and eighty two hundreds
um
um
um
over two hundred and eighty but that one has to has to take six to seven hours I really can't do it also it has to transfer around so I think it's unnecessary besides the time
really ah
ah
it's also
which means it only has the night the late night
um ah
otherwise have to be Saturday night Saturday Saturday night it would be very late and then it means I lost my entire day on Saturday
um
ah
so I think besides besides it also has to fly on Sunday you have to
yes it seems to be
take off relatively earlier because it happens to take seven hours so in this way I take off at twelve o'clock ha would be also arrived there at sevenish
ah
yes
yes needs to be needs to be at seven o'clock as well yes
to to that Chicago whatever
yes
um
so
I must I um which means Monday it happens to be that that date that day is well wasted anyway
um
yes
yes
yes well you happen to indeed this is not bad for you working for a few months having worked for a few months you need to take a rest for several days well that's fine
three hundred and fifty six um this
yes
right then it then it actually later my this ASSOCIATE told me he said that their this for your next year aren't there two weeks off huh he said he
um
yes
they um are not really clear about this vocation you can um if it's okay you can just um TAKE MORE THAN that
no um
whatever you want is fine
need to invite more well is it right your that
er right two but you just can't necessarily can't you can't take two two weeks off all at once you can just do it by taking one week one time
um
yes yes
yes yes I know because he's mainly quite busy there he he has no idea at all he just said next week later he became especially occupied so if he would give you two weeks in a snap
just in the middle of it there is supposed to be one BREAK
yes
yes
yes
if he's really occupied there isn't anyone else yes so it would surely be like that yes
right just like this so it just you can go like this one week and another week then you can use it with any HOLIDAY in this way you can have more than one week off
yes
yes
yes
just you can do like this if you see that what
um
it just so not necessarily has to be two not necessarily has to be two weeks off
yes actually and also actual in that way this is even even better than than granting your leave for two weeks because if you need to add that well HOLIDAY
yes
that is
if adding that vocation inside you in this way just say about it that's more or less fine sometime you'd be able to rest for seven or eight days or something about ten days yes
yes
yeah just like this
yes
otherwise if you take several days off together it would simply be just two weeks
right just like this
um
so so this is good
ah
it that
well after you finished yesterday until what time in the evening were you busy
I yesterday anyway worked to actually I later worked to um I past five o'clock anyway I had nothing to do but I needed to wait for that ASSOCIATE just in case in case she needed any help
um
oh she wanted to see your result what's that
I right just in case she'd change again change again then I had to again catch up with her there but anyway finally when it came to past eight o'clock I took leave our this DEAL was just almost done ah
um
um
um
um
ah that would do
so now now he at least um that this they today they mainly they're busy last night just because they needed to attend the BOARD MEETING
um
so um they today that what
um
today they just would all attend the BOARD MEETING this ASSOCIATE and that PARTNER
ah
so I for the moment am available I now just hope that tonight they had better not come back they sometimes they sometimes go and come back at the same day
um
went yesterday or last night I have no idea whether they will come back today I now just hope
if you don't come back today well come back tomorrow you'd also have lots of things tomorrow
tomorrow Friday you see tomorrow is Friday he sometimes this ASSOCIATE probably he has no idea of that what huh
they wouldn't do that on Friday
this is simply taking days off myself
um
he but they mainly see if he has lot of things to do of course he has to you know if there are many things to do on that meeting later he probably would
that is
right he might still need to still be very busy because like us over this we already like me last weekend too was busy with just this
um
we most most this this for this DEAL we've invested so much time in it
ah
actually we people now anyway like me and that my SECRETARY the both of us just hope that no more um that what
ah
yes because it doesn't yes doesn't have a lot to do with you like you anyway after you got the salary something in the future yes yes that's true actually
change over and over again
and then
but for our dividend there should be some impact on it
I that that ASSOCIATE already told me he said for the moment they probably have started the discussion about the dividend
um
they are already discussing the when do they get the sharing
because because PARTNER
we'll get the dividend at the end of this year
ah is it then you are pretty good
because I because we already we already are able to choose you can choose to get the dividend next year but no one would like to choose next year EXEMPT TAX
ah ah
um yeah right
yes exactly
actually all would choose to get dividend this year just get dividend if possible this year already
um
um huh yes yes
anyway you can get some then he said that that day they according to him that day because PARTNER every every Wednesday every every Monday there's one meeting they're all there
yes
um
um ah
um
yes um
just he said he said
Monday this this ASSOCIATE said that he went pass that door the PARTNER just shut the door immediately
um
he said they must be probably probably were talking about the dividend
ah
discussing the sharing yes
right they didn't want him to hear that
yes the US yes this sharing is mainly depended on the performance of your company in the US
so
so now we this but we now this now one guy left this is good
yes
he anyway one guy left but for our this money so I think they now are not in any hurry to look for that because now I
um
yes once getting that man now yes
right after that guy left
I was quite busy right after that guy left
um
now they probably get used to it again um
because I've I've already made the things again I made I it can be said that the mess which the guy left has already
um
it's all done yes
did it right
so he I think that now they actually are kind of picky like us we already INTERVIEW twice two people I I also INTERVIEW them and
um
um
um
oh you also join going to that meeting ha
um ah that's not bad actually happen the company pays for it
they are pretty good
yes
right each time I just right
but it means your company also pay for your meals
right but in that way the food has to be better
um
ah right
and also be able to take the chance to eat outside
so I follow me to do twice
seize the chance to not go to work at noon
right but I but I don't know which one they chose in the end when they finally decided who to choose they I wasn't there to participate
um
um
yes
right I don't know them but they anyway I know they had a discussion that day but after the discussion no one mentioned that to me in this way this ASSOCIATE didn't mention it to me either whether they would hire someone or not
um
um
because now I also guess that they might not select yet not not possibly to hire someone
um ah
otherwise at least he should tell me about it but who knows they also this ACCOMPANY sometimes they might not tell me what they have done
yes
yes
so
I don't know either but I think normally because this guy is supposed to be the closest person to my work
um
yes but but they yes yes but they are general yes
if he if they decided to hire someone
at least they should tell me it seems that's the way it is
they want to hire this person
yes but they mainly because your position is too low here they think what you said actually what should you do if your opinion is different with theirs just in case so they are not
them
yes
oh right for this they're not
um
um
yes
yes
but I just what I mean is I say I think if they hired someone they must normally they should tell me about it
yes should be yes
yes that's for sure because at the end in the future helping of whatever it's certainly you offered to help the most yes
yes
yeah therefore now I just now I am guess I don't know if they hire that people I know they had discussion before but I am saying that they did not mention it to me after discussion
um
um
huh
ah
ah
ah
because I think or they should have told me but sometimes nobody knows they may also
um
um
who knows so now I am still guessing I don't know if they hire that people now I feel that it doesn't matter whether they hire that guy to be honest I may have less to do after the employment now I have already been
even you are there now if even you play games now yes well whatever happens you'd be even more well
now I am playing games here again
yeah but I yeah
but just like at that time when I was really busy with the DEAL that was really busy
um
yes
not late Friday five o'clock is already is already a bit late for us I today until five o'clock in the morning well you it's equal to doing more more day's work more or less doing for twelve more hours
hmm right
that is
like Saturday and Sunday we also have to work overtime from twelve o'clock to nine o'clock in the evening
that's is yes
that is almost if it is really busy you still have something to work on
yes I said
just but not that busy I just feel that it is way less than New York I also called New York
um um
um
they always work till twelve or one and nine o'clock would be early for them to leave sometimes I just left earlier than them they said
um
wow
they asked me if it is TEN O'CLOCK I said no I said I CONSIDER that just that one
that would be evening
just six o'clock yeah
yes
SIX O'CLOCK yeah I said I need to leave early
um um
um um
they cannot believe it and they have to work almost every weekend there is not a weekend that they are not working in
ah
would be you originally those people who were trained together with you right ah
yes
those people
that is
ah
so so you know just like our STANDARD it is way less than New York so I
well can't you tell them tell them that they they should should have some opinion
they all know they all know this in Chicago they know the whole FIRM in you know compare to the New York one the LOCAL FIRM is is more
um
that yes more that HEADQUARTER yes it's headquarter needs that well yes
more relaxed yeah
they all know about this
um
so
now it is that
yes yes don't hurry up hiring people
no need to worry about it just hire a person first because they think although I am busy but it is still less than New York they think I may I should
yes
UH-HUH
thinking you should do a bit more work
maybe I can deal with it
but actually it is true that I can still deal with it actually
huh yes
yes
but now my problem is when I am thinking about the bonus thing I feel that it is good to have one people less
yes
yes yes yes because it if there's lots of money everyone could simply everyone would receive more and take more money yes
otherwise that
we need to
yes
yes
people need to take out some so I think they many it is not sure that they want to have one people less when the bonus time is coming
yes
yes
and people can get more so
um
who knows let us wait and see where the employment is going to
um
anyway to me it is
oh I know I am telling you there is nothing funny I just remember that I forgot to tell you that do you remember the place we stayed during SUMMER
um
ah remember
SUBLET the place didn't I tell you that refrigerator has been burn out just because of the refrigerator
yes you said that is especially not good
ah yes there's no refrigerator
are you
wow
it's okay
that that person is really that guy kept using the refrigerator when he was back how cheap he is
um
really now it's broken again
really it is just a refrigerator and it was CAUGHT ON FIRE
ah
because it was too old and he may do something to the PLUG IN
yes yes it's likely that the WIRE yes sometimes isn't good yes
yeah really
the whole house was burn out now he the person had a good relationship with the LANDLADY as a result the LANDLADY SUE him
ah
now he stays in
eh yes I even I mean maybe don't have an insurance at all right
right that LANDLADY has no insurance
oh
well he just
ah
um
but truth be told that LANDLADY I assume that you won't get a lot of money from her however hard you try to but huh CHRIS said if he got sued she could just say deduct from his monthly salary
yes
in this way he submits it a little by little yes
yes
deduct from that SALARY like that deduct
pass what
yes
really I simply I cannot believe I think it never occur to me that how come this one one FRIDGE CAUGHT ON FIRE
yes it happens all the time in this this America which is this kind of things yes there are many things sometimes but I wouldn't have thought of it I say you were even living in there still using those at that time
uh huh yeah
right we lived there but later we never put that into use we later CHRIS later found an opportunity later we simply bought a new one a small FRIDGE
yes yes I know what do you use there
um
yes
this guy should totally do that too later this guy should continue to use that FRIDGE you see
yes
but that thing I think just that the landlord is bad see your house is not particularly cheap this kind of house how would it which is the house normally would definitely have all have
UH-HUH
all have fridges like that day I stayed at Xiao Hen's place we live in that live in that small house that fridge wasn't working well too but at least you can still work at that place
oh
UH-HUH
yeah yeah I'm still here let me tell you I know your this you mean different
um
are you
most places in um CALIFORNIA there are no house like ours if you live in APARTMENT BUILDING this is just like one big what REAL ESTATE AGENT or this is one just private house and you're just one
um
um
it's a private house it should be provided
you can just one by one is a private house it doesn't matter at all whether you provide it or not it's not like your that what right
right ah
your that is typically STANDARD if you're like that then like what we live in like we live in this kind of APARTMENT BUILDING
yes
yes
like they in CALIFORNIA most live in this kind of LANDLADY
yes but like when we lived in the original place it also with with that we originally I originally lived in that old lady's place something sort of it she also had a fridge that you could share with her it's completely
UH-HUH
right you see but he no no no his this again means different his this house is totally separate right his whole actually so his this got burnt down totally nothing nothing like that house that LANDLADY's house
she has a house herself
ah
then he that house should be then this house should be very cheap like it doesn't have these things
because temporarily his that but he actually
the problem is that his that house actually is in CALIFORNIA the whole house is comparatively expensive compared to that to here actually so like where he stays is probably relatively cheap
ah
ah
ah
but actually compared to where we stay it is comparatively expensive
say that
and his that whole is separate just like two persons live next to each other like what we see back in China
um
yes I know yes
a home a yard
yes yes yes
yes
yes yes I remember didn't you even get bitten a lot
so
yeah yeah just just here
got bitten over the whole body
yeah he just FLEA and back and see that who has told me that FLEA which leads when I see FLEA I will feel
um
um
um
just because he is too dirty I think he the FLEA you can imagine that
um
they are all at that
yes yes
anyway later he well so he the house of his was burn out the hourse owner's house was was gone and he was still fine
um
ah
it is a small business to that landlord she has one that he grow something himself
um
just the er cactus
ah
she selling cactus but he this winter he doesn't has any income mainly rely on the rent
ah
ah
so she now I think the landlord in fact I KRIS always says that the landlord is a pitiful guy actually I think the landlord just pretend he is poor and I think he is smart
um
really um
um
in fact it is not sure that you can be poor because of that
yes
yes yes
yes
but yeah if it is true
yes but anyway at least you don't feel this is for sure yes
yeah yes it is sure
especially that house it was supposed you can bring you how much income a year right
yes
at least yeah at least she has four or five hundred every month
because he fixed it ha which means she doesn't have to put on any effort on that thing
right
the house is there she just makes money there just makes money there unlike us you have to go to work to make money her money is just there which means
that is
yes
yes
the money is free anyway so why not now suddenly it's gone that would be very you know yes
that is
yes
like this
really
I think it is good the landlord was mad because the landlord has told that guy that do not buy the refrigerator she was very anyway the refrigerator
um
um
she said the refrigerator was too old
um
but that guy did not listen and he bought the refrigerator but to be honest I think that guy should be responsible and it is because that he wanted to save money so it ate
um
yes yes
actually it is very obvious that if it is not him who wanted to save the money he can still live there
exactly yes
so I think it is
however to file a lawsuit at there in her place ha I don't know in the future after the lawsuit is over actually if you are not really rich the lawsuit would cost you a lot of money I think American people in lawsuit are actually also
that
yeah I I now I cannot figure out if the man will go to court but I think that may be threatening him
um
yes like that time of ours didn't the car hit ours then the man did the hitting didn't have money
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
later we of course took money from the insurance company he but he well the other guy those people at there they just didn't have money
well he returned some he started to return some but he is there is a guy an old guy his car might worth more than a thousand bucks
seems also unrepairable because it's just a little more than one thousand bucks would you have it repaired to repair it would cost nearly one thousand bucks but he returned he didn't return all
later it has been said that he would need to sue asked us if we would sue together later we said forget it anyway we already got got money from the insurance company just just just forget it
UH-HUH
oh
yes I do think I do think I think for that guy actually just a few buck why would would he sue
UH-HUH who knows anyway now I I think I don't know if someone sues the person actually whether the person
um
I just feel that I don't like the LANDLADY I just don't like this guy
ah
I just feel that but I think this time both of them were and LANDLADY used to like the guy very much and the man was living there and she was talking about how good the man is because the man used to flattered her
um
are you
always kiss her ass and saying that she is the best LANDLADY ever and now the two people
really ah
yes American people sometimes are quite good at flattering others yes yes yes
yeah I just think it is funny that these two people have already
turned into enemies to each other
yes that that's that's absolutely right so you see but well but this is entirely the man's fault anyway this is the man's fault yes this house yes
they are now on the opposite side of each other
yeah the man was not good either and the landlord said that the man had not admitted the mistake yet
ah
never admitted that it was his fault I think the man I don't know why he refused to admit it I don't know who could be blame for that I think it is too obvious that it is him
he probably that is because that guy didn't provide a fridge should have provided a fridge and what not yes I'm not I don't know clearly yes
but it is not sure just feel that he is a cheap guy but I am sure that the landlord is very cheap
he must thought the landlord may be
um
very much like that very cheap and well doing that thing with him
um
yeah but I think it is funny from my side the house was burn out just in a flash
yes me too I know what you think look you see I was living there back then now look everything is gone
yes
now I can still remember that we were talking about the problems of the house but we cannot imagine the this big issue will happen
yes I know I remember that you called me everyday every time you called you complained to me alas no way to go shopping got bitten and so on
yes
yeah the
yeah at that time we bought stuff
yeah it was very inconvenient not it is fine it is all gone burn out
but who know but I have seen I but speaking of pitiful it is to the
anyway this is also this thing yes yes just just uh our uh the old car of ours one hit could shatter the glasses
yes
yes
that is
you still you are also quite you know how come you also drive that car
yes
ah I remember this talking about this I remember Hang Bing Hang Bing you see all the bad breaks of his car let me tell you in the beginning he got got you know his car
no choices
yes
yes
yes
yes yes the city council what what's that
yes actually probably the first time was done by the city hall now he's even screwed I am telling you
I got trouble again
still not over the trouble is not over that car
he he is not doing that sham marriage it's not that he doesn't do the sham marriage it's not equal to marriage he's married now do you now not
really I don't know oh to to me she said something like not married instead that is she said seems like making a decision with looking at just one
yes he's married so he he doesn't go back
he he doesn't go back
yes he still decided with that girl at the end but he didn't want to go back to the home country and get married so he just with her now many domestic people are doing the same thing that is the guy get married just right here
ah
ah
yes yes yeah
um
ah
then would get it done for the girl but he's a smart ass
he he backed to the home country last year he's afraid the public security bureau would ask him how did you get married without coming back ha just found out he didn't go back to the country so they put the date of last year on the marry registration
um
um
um
ah
but turn out don't know how the public security bureau got him as falsifying it
yes now he's in big trouble now public security bureau now this girl is not applying for the passport just got caught by the public security bureau
wow
wow
this is this guy doesn't come back at all so this two people are not officially because it's required by the country if you are a guy that is both the guy and girl have to be there
um
um
ah
you can only get married in that way also also not to mention he even put a fake date on it something like this
yes yes
so now he's screwed
I don't know now it's still not clear what's going on with this
actually I think in China I think it seems there's supposed to be a way to get fake marriage done it wouldn't be by other people you fake
I think what's the name of the guy
faking is everyone faking should so there should be a way to do it
yes
yes there are many people falsifying it yes that that person just that wife said their family didn't invite someone so certainly it's
yes right I think right i just think when they at that time were searching for a way it wasn't so wasn't so good they themselves were made confused
also there's no any relations
ah but that mainly mainly their family that that girl's family is particularly useless they are not trying to help at all
are you
the key is Han Bing his family also go to find and then Han Bing's father doesn't care at all his mom is absolutely
ah
um
is against this also he said they back then when they were getting married his mom asked him five times whether he really wanted to marry this woman
um
um
um
um
um
um
but they besides the connection is also through their family and then that family doesn't have money then Han Bing also also sends money to her family
um um
hey wow
wow well how would Han Bing like such a person so much
so that
I actually Han Bing doesn't like me that much I don't know Han Bing he's always so hesitant I just I think I think Han Bing actually this person is so useless so pathetic so useless in fact
well and also and also so hesitant and indecisive and and feel and think and then and and and unwilling and like that then also feels lonely in the end just in the end just ends up like this
then you see also gives money to her family and uses connections for her family then that family does nothing
yes but also that family does nothing that family that family
yes I'd say if it weren't for I'd say if you don't like it especially that much well forget it just find another one he at that time yes that time when he came to our
that's right I also think so
he back then met that person
house well he was leaving soon well at that time just asked him he said later said he said he didn't want to get married it seems to mean that he had just seen one person only
he seemed to mean no it's more seemed to be what's the matter
he just talked like this then he he didn't didn't want to do anything either then asked him to find someone else he just said alas I contacted this woman by phone all the time to do that again
yes
to start dating again would feel so so not reconciled being with a person like this uh anyway this person is so pathetic I just think he can only blame himself
yes indeed
yes
I think lots of people are this kind of indecisive people he's just like that can't do anything about it
um yes yes very unlucky let me tell you for example some people are so bold didn't they didn't they well maybe just slipped through
yes
yes
yes
yes well people he has been looking for are always like that yes
he just thinks too much and is also like that in the end in the end trying to be smart in the end had been too smart you see
yes
yes I think that's the case they yes
he well anyway don't know how he is now
if I had known earlier I'd have gone back myself to get married after getting married it's all over that's how it is yes
that's not as good as at then he should have just married just married that time well since at then
since the result in the end is like this back then should have back then back then still so hesitant and wanted to meet some more
yes how much trouble this would have saved yes
as a result you see actually no better than got married then didn't meet any more he didn't didn't meet anyone either actually
yes
that is
just at there talk on his own he was always talking but did nothing then he currently
yes you see he's again um you can't really do anything with some people's personality such people's personality
then he for now
yes the work problem now he he now the thesis he doesn't focus on writing it well he he now he doesn't have any jobs and also in a few years his that funding would be gone
um
um
isn't that right ah
um
ah
now Song Chin is still the way he used to be he is still studying
he seems to be still at school ha wasn't he originally thinking of finding a job later something like that er didn't look for anything
yes but he he just found out that
he hasn't he has never thought of finding a job he he er no he he hasn't had such an idea
wasn't he that that time when he didn't pass he seemed to
when he didn't pass he didn't have such an idea either when he didn't pass what he decided was was simply if he doesn't pass it again this year
oh if he fails again would begin begin to look for one
yes he'd just he would just find a job
ah
ah now he again found out again that if he now this year wants again to
but I think he this year based on reason is supposed to have a great possibility of passing the exams of two courses
um
he also found out that if he doesn't pass this year he he next year besides he won't have just just won't have any subsidies
um
it is said his scholarship is for four years but if you you this need to pass the exams of two courses within three years
um
if he doesn't pass the the third year
they would then give you scholarship for the fourth year so he said if he doesn't pass this year so if he looks for a job then he would probably have to face an economic difficulty something like that
um
um
um
um
so
um who knows but I think I think there's a great possibility that he would pass
um
yes yes
anyway now it's just
yes alas such a thing that wouldn't be that wouldn't be wouldn't be our stuff we wouldn't just couldn't decide such a thing
hopefully he is
yes
yes
yes
so who knows he anyway is now is now in such a SITUATION
yes
um um well okay um um
but I think um huh
what were you trying to say just now
there's nothing I was just thinking what else can I ask you is there any more fun there something like that
there's nothing more I just think I just think it's quite light hearing about this it's quite well this alas this guy now I don't know at all that he's really special I just think although he's quite annoying
are you
a while ago made a phone call saying that in their neighborhood what are the places to eat that FREE well they have that
oh my god
um
how come their Math Department didn't contact well whatever FIRM what happened it has a it seems to be something like a COCKTAIL PARTY you can use it to do
ah um
um
um
my goodness
ah
what on earth is this then that that moreover that that Ju Yong that just another one that person who came newly to our Economics Department he just tole me that
um
um
he simply simply simply that husband he just told me he said this one who is it Han Bing
um
um
even always that well even always runs to other people's CHURCH to eat for FREE
doesn't CHURCH have a little bit of FREE FOOD or something
yes yes yes we originally begin in the very beginning we also went to that well went to eat at the church all because it's Chinese it's a church for Chinese people it's also
OK
it simply encourages everyone I mean at first it uses such stuff to attract you I mean well joining that party and then you can have your meals or something
oh
so in the beginning they Xiao-Han also said said they well simply
they some people were they did go there but they felt embarrassed at first because they seemed to think that those religious people would think the non-religious people don't seem to be very well something like that
UH-HUH
UH-HUH
oh
er so i mean that well that means
UH HUH
er my goodness we go just for the meals let's go the they simply went there
well I ate there just once anyway I ate once probably eating a bit too much anyway I came just had my meal here once
UH HUH
oh
had my meal once later we didn't go it wasn't especially good anyway just everyone was just it has new people some people brought rice there and they simply put it on the table
yes
oh
if you want I'll just the most important is at last I want everyone just well verify how well the master helped me
%null
that part that stuff that of course everyone does it out of their own initiative but I always think that kind of stuff is ha
UH-HUH
I don't know well some people are really or only something is it true or false or something it was because of that meal that they said something like that
don't know much about it um
he even ran always he seemed to run there just that kind of black people there well I don't know exactly what CHURCH he just ran there
really then he just let that black guy we are we here have this kind of we here and also we here now at the CHURCH they said now basically it's all the Chinese mainlanders I at first when we went they were all Taiwanese people yes
um
right
oh yes now there are many mainlanders who begin to be religious I know when I was there I just saw they seems to some people are really quite devoted I'm telling you some people
yes all of them um um
um
then well anyway it's this who this this Han Bing at that time what medicine did he buy to take I just mean after finishing eating he'd say he himself doesn't want to eat anything
um
ah
are you
whatever whatever vitamin tablets he has no idea what it is he's just he's just this can save him a meal
um um
I think he's just here to think about these doing this calculation actually he'd do better looking actively for a job himself out there or
um
yes yes
how to come up with some solution he
yes the point is to find something to do it'd be okay to have some job otherwise if you just save money there isn't much you can save
too this is also needed needed yes otherwise
simply and also and also
as long as something like your rent is added you can't save money at all you could only live off your past gains definitely need to have a job
yes
that is
yes and also I think you you and also otherwise you hurry up and finish your DISSERTATION you need to finish it soon that's it but he works on it with so sluggishly he this
um
yes yes
yes
he's now he passes every day rather comfortably now he's well sleeping
every day in the morning he sleeps in probably until almost eleven or twelve o'clock then in the afternoon still need to take again again a take an afternoon nap again
really ah
it's already eleven or twelve o'clock are you still taking an afternoon nap
he until six or seven o'clock in the evening yes not yet at just four or five o'clock he again TAKEs a NAP
that would help me go to sleep a bit later at night
ah
what do you say this is it's simply I such a person like him so I think he himself is to blame he deserves it you just say something
um
I'll give it to you when I'm back
yes there's nothing else actually I would give it to you when I am back
right
hi that's fine well that's it
OK BYE
hello Luo Ren hello
hello
can you hear
I heard that I heard that
fuck
oh I I I
over there
ah
I sat for the exam of GRE here
and made forty-five dollars
what
here we
you took GRE
we have a math section for GRE here
and then
there are thirty five questions
um
and the you you you
er you will get twenty yuan when you finished and fifty five yuan if you get all correct
ouch how could he do that
it is for the ETS needs needs
oh I SEE I SEE
needs to change the type of question
find find some to test
ah
and then I was wrong
er
you will deduct five yuan for every wrong answer
oh that way
um huh
fucking I I didn't get such a chance but I took a TSE just before I came here I at that time
um huh
TA
I'm screwed the department asks for TSE exam
how about
finished
er I got two hundred and seventy
all passed
that is fucking high
ah
ah
you took the exam without any preparations and you get this score fuck
haha I that is just before I came one month before I came
um huh
watched it crazily and followed with all kinds of videos I fuck
um huh
hah oh it took a lot of time
after arriving here I I just say
it's over I didn't take that exam until a week later after I I came here
ah
I just practiced a lot in this week
um huh
after that I didn't practice it much
you are the RA you don't need that
now I can't either
yeah and then there was a buddy who asked me
be RA huh he mentioned
this um around October there's one fund huh
um huh
raise one fund from which to be a RA huh
um huh
RA is good for my RA many would get very very um what
um huh
very very envious huh
um huh
young man
um um
why huh my RA finishes within three years huh
that is PHD
PH D right
then why do you take the MS course you are already take the PHD
no I just want to be like this
why choose MS if you do choose MS you have to finish courses
all the ten courses do you know
um huh
just for one MS
um huh
oh I know
right for my RA I can choose four courses
um
aren't you a FELLOW
as FELLOW you should finish four courses huh a week huh a semester
um huh
I take three courses this semester
ah
you just finished three courses huh
yeah I got four course and we all changed to three once the American DIRECTOR left
why
why
damn it we need to find our graduate tutors this semester we we are all RA we will start as RA from next year the first year we are FELLOW he would not care
no
for your RA you need one more semester huh
yes after one QUATER but I this I still have to look for one myself
well no even someone asks
I need to spend
I need to spend lots of time to talk it over with my boss the boss is always very crafty
but we now here too ah TA is all like this um finish three three three um COURSEs
um huh
he actually
I'm the first one among us here I'm the first one among us here to settle down and also the PROJECT I I'm doing is
ah
how about that classmate of you yours that classmate of yours is also there or not
the best for those who study materials
which one
you well schoolmate from the same class
I have yeah
is also there just just the two of you
yes yes yes
there are also two there's also Tsinghua Tsinghua's last four
Tsinghua altogether four of us
and then there's one more added five altogether
oh
oh
also
ah
there's another one from the Chinese Academy of Sciences a graduate student who's coming over
five
just five from China
ah no no this eight from China
W
eight from China
um
fuck
you guys over there are really awesome
our department recruited fifty there's a FELLOW for everyone
our department is fucking too rich fuck
fuck you indeed is very rich
we over here can't really do it
we here have recruited again nine plus altogether just nine
good China recruited three all of whom from Tsinghua fuck we don't know those people
really
ah there's a Singaporean one
we over here
exactly him he graduated he's
the one from the Automobile Department
finished worked for one year in Singapore and after that he came here
um
um
he studied ROBOTICS
eh you what department is yours Department of Mechanical Engineering
in mechanical engineering and well applied mechanics
when I I I I came I I said I'm looking for a boss I can also transfer to DOUBLE E fuck at the end I didn't want to transfer
ah yes that of yours you are MATERIAL SCIENCE
I'm from CHEMICAL ENGINEERING AND MATERIAL SCIENCE but now I
I however I know that your your major is MATERIAL SCIENCE
now I transfer to CHEMICAL ENGINEERING I because I do POLYMER's COATING
oh
you you've already changed
yes I I've found a boss he does exactly this so I switched my major
oh oh oh
it's just last time you told me that a few few of that something
this this er er it's doing that of something something
that that
high molecule
well macromolecule and then that
polymer coating
coating is that right
yes
oh
I this
you've already changed to that
ouch I it's very easy for me this is the it
didn't you say that you still still needed some consideration
yeah when I looked at it later all were robbing everyone stared at me I didn't go everyone went to the American and then an American said to me he said
well he said he said you go to the boss and do this PROJECT it's like you've got a job in the future as soon as I heard that I hurried to make it finalized I said I would like to go would like to go
actually I may transfer to DOUBLE VE but DOUBLE E I think about transfer to DOUBLE E damn it I was asked to MADISON fucking
oh I SEE I SEE I SEE
then so I was just I was just at MINNINOPOLIS I thought damn it I need to I need to
so so your situation is pretty good this of yours
I'm going to transfer to chemicals and I want
right your chemical engineering is good your chemical engineering is pretty good ranking Number One across the whole America
yeah it ranks the first in the United States and the POLYMER COATING I chose is very good for job hunting because
everything needs to use that nowadays
my my professor all the have graduated now he has to recruit new students this year
ah
and his students went to that kind of electronics company in California
damn dude you are so lucky
ah
yeah I was fucking lucky
good good good good
and then I have two ADVISOR and one ADVISOR is just to analyze how well the COATING is made his name is Dian Jin the professor of Dian Jin
ah
just graduated from Cambridge and then snatched by three M company with a huge sum of money from Cornell
ah ah ah
ah ah
under his management in GROUP the students joined his GROUP MEETING are all American
they're all from Cornell damn it
really
so I him two bosses led me and then
fuck
anyway I'm now
then it's okay okay good good
I might come to your place once next year
so good
ah might come once I'm not
when is that
I'm not quite sure yet might come here once because there there is one that is
annually I mean it's it's it's that that conference from this PROJECT of ours
you are doing something aren't you
ah
doing what did you do
we now I'm now doing the I mean inside vertical tubes that two floating that simulation using that CFD
exactly that type
which channel isn't it not talking about that er the flowing of heat heat and material something like that
eh you can put it this way I mean it's
ah
isn't that the range of chemical engineering
ah that's also true actually now when I take courses I always go to class with students from the Chemical Engineering Department
oh well well well well our department our department is doing exactly such stuff doing chemical engineering a whole bunch of people doing exactly this because I haven't studied it before so I looked for them none of them wanted me
oh oh oh oh oh you in the Chemical Engineering Department also doing this well I am it'd be good if I transfer here in less than a year fuck you the courses I take here are all
oh you eh I I tell
ah
let me me tell you who are the people that got transferred transferred here there are two students who switched majors
the Department of Chemical Engineering doesn't take Chinese people I mean our department of chemical engineering never takes Chinese people
took two Chinese one is transferred from the Department of Chemical Engineering at Purdue
there's another one who's female from Tsinghua's Department of Chemical Engineering you perhaps heard saying that she came abroad just this year
since she got transferred here
CAL TECH
Cal Tech
oh CIT
got transferred from CIT
ah ah she also transferred here
everyone is coming toward here
like the fucking ordinary students he never wants them
do you know new new MATERIAL SCIENCE after coming here and then
after coming here then he said your supervisor is not decided yet find a supervisor from the Chemical Engineering
then you do a PROJECT on chemical engineering you said you just transferred
ah
it is super hard if you want to directly join them they don't recruit Chinese people
really
it is fucking disgusting and when we go to the tutors from department of chemical industry
the competition is very fierce that every one wants to join the department of chemical industry
then he doesn't want Chinese people
and I then I was so lucky
why doesn't he want Chinese people
shit it is super easy to for the chemical industry here the chemical industry here to find jobs
well why don't they want Chinese people
this this damn it wouldn't be so serious I guess
no Chinese yeah there is a discrimination against Chinese many Americans go there it hires a lot the there is a discrimination against us
it can't be not the problem of language language barrier or something else
it is not about the language
the Chinese students are recruited into the department of material even you have the chemical industry BACKGROUND
students in the department of chemical industry are all from United States
really
yes
after joining the college like this you can find a tutor a tutor in department of chemical industry because here
in fact the department of chemical industry combines the department of material and named as chemical industry and material
here the department of material will serve the department of chemical industry anyway
not really it is also compare to you just send your documents first
um
and the department of chemical industry here is fucking number so there is more money every year
um
you you
people know if you you want to change tot DOUBLE E
I want to change to DOUBLE E so I am not looking for a tutor now I just tell them that I have not find a suitable one yet
then I worked very hard on my learning my college will make me as a fellow anyway
ah
I have not find my tutor yet and the college keeps making me as a FELLOW
um
um
then I finally got got got full got a Master's degree then I transferred there
transfer transferring to DOUBLE E I can also do it this way
really
yes you can do it this way now there's a there are several Chinese students who are doing this they they won't look for
he just takes money from the department
the department is quite worried and is always always pushing them to find one
they always say they can't find a suitable one
yes it's the same for us here
for some he already in the seventh year still not graduated yet not yet
the Department has been supporting him do you know that
yes
sometimes he doesn't find a supervisor he just
yes yes yes
won't do it
and also I you see our department fuck here
anyway I I think our department this is very the POLICY is so special in every way different from all the other departments
including our department there are four academicians from the National Academy of Engineering American
all majoring in chemical engineering chemical engineering
really
there are four fuck this is too fierce one person
your department is quite big I suppose
our department is quite large our department recruited fifty people this year
ah studying altogether
recruiting graduate students
graduate students fifty people for GRADUATE
the enrollment is limited to fifty students
um
my goodness that's really something
this is a really big department
very large
fifty students for a department can be big
only fifty students get enrolled each year
my department is it's exactly so the College of Engineering at the U of Minnesota simply depends on this department and also that well
um
and also the Department of Mechanical Engineering the Department of Mechanical Engineering at U of M ranks the eighth
um
simply depends on these several departments
fuck you
advancing the ranking of U of M's engineer Minnesota U of M's engineering fuck
um
moving it forward
um um
what's the ranking for University of Minnesota Twin Cities now
the engineering of University of Minnesota ranks ten to twenty
fourteen or fifteen
fourteenth fifteenth
and then integrated ha GRADUATE SCHOOL
what about comprehensive comprehensive huh
ah
the GRADUATE SCHOOL ranks twenty twenty five a little bit lower
twenty fifth
ah
yes
only a few departments in University of Minnesota are strong
um
and then
yes
and the chemical engineering CHEMICAL ENGINEERING was in the rank this year there are three three AGENCY conducting the rank
um
it ranks the top at the first two AGENCY ranking and for the third one it
both rank first
it ties the first with MIT it is the top one in the three rankings anyway
ah
oh for the third one it is a little higher than MIT
ah
almost
ah ah ah
also the top one
therefore the dean of chemical engineering has been promoted this year
speaking of the DEAN in INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY because he said that your department of chemical engineering is always the top one in United States when you are the dean of this department
then your performance was quite good so speaking of the
INSTITUTE so you need to make INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY
this actually this
not something he by himself can make happen right
not about the mechanism
no the key issue is also about funds our ineptitude has a lot funds
yes
the funds for the PROJECT are sponsored by the company
supported by a powerful chemical engineering company that provides provides materials
what company huh
it is ELF AUTO CHEMISTRY
an American company
ah ah ah
doing chemical engineering then he he he would offer me some samples
we do have it here
over there
not er nope nope nope that that that
called Du Pont Company huh
there's one MARSHAL LAB with Du Pont Company that's based here
yes yes yes
many students from the Department of Chemical Engineering would would go there
we here we here are too big we here the biggest boss is three M THREE M THREE M
oh oh oh
THREE M's headquarter is here fuck
yes
then they give especially lots of money here like us here
and also here some of our bosses are all just from well Bell's Laboratory
um
isn't Bell's disbanded
yes
transferring here from them there fuck
and also have obtained national laboratory
ah
fuck
that's really awesome
eh I I I just think this department is awesome so you see that day wen we went to
quite awesome quite awesome quite awesome
ah
er their University of Minnesota Medical School they're doing that well
investigation well China in in Chinese people elders in the United States he's doing this well
DEPRESS I mean that kind of depression
um
then everyone just sits together and then
self-introducing which department which department they are all some of the well bad departments well Department of Psychology
um huh
well Department of Architecture
um
and also well
NURSE SCHOOL and also fucking NURSE SCHOOL fucking girls fuck them
when I stood up I just said a phrase well CHEMICAL ENGINEERING everyone beep beep beep their eyes all turned here
everyone knows CHEMICAL ENGINEERING is the best at U of M fuck
really
yes they they can't possibly compare
we here WHARTON SCHOOL is the coolest fuck you
what is there over your side
WHARTON SCHOOL do you know that
no er you know learning
it's a BUSINESS SCHOOL
you know learning
oh oh oh
WHARTON SCHOOL at that time hasn't Lianxi been hankering after it
I mean eh first MIT's SLOAN after that the second would be WHARTON SCHOOL
here WHARTON SCHOOL has also been the fucking coolest
University of Pennsylvania is not bad er UPENN is not bad UPENN is very good
UPenn this year ranks the eleventh the overall ranking is the eleventh
GRADUATE
heh yes just GRADUATE
actually you see the main reputation of a university all depends on the well thriving of the GRADUATE STUDENT
um
you UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT don't actually count that much
UNDER Meiji University is even beforehand UNDER Meiji University is more beforehand
UNDER don't count that much UNDER are just its I mean normally normally they don't take that into consideration the main ranking depends just on this
um
yes yes yes
yes
the key is Meiji University this school is too big other departments
are suck like you know liberal arts is too Meiji University is suck
Meiji University engineering
that AGRICULTURE of Meiji University also ranks the first in the United States that is agriculture
oh oh oh oh
Agriculture
oh
oh oh oh
damn the others are not ok fuck it
oh
are all suck
we here actually are not so good at ART AND SCIENCE
ah
for ART AND SCIENCE I mean
actually
there's only one department that can get by
only CHEMISTRY is okay
Department of Chemical Engineering of Meiji University is stink fuck it's really stink fuck
Chemistry Department of Minnesota U of M is quite notorious right he
it's stink right Department of Chemical Engineering
this this U of M this UPenn Chemistry Department is still very
quite awesome
Department of Chemistry back then just it's very
several professors received Nobel Prize
old man fuck it are all
have to look for the boss in earlier time I fucking did damn it
just feeling it's slim chance
has to study data again of my profession damn its studying again
well you did you get interviewed one by one or just deliver materials one by one ah
fuck it there are so many FACULTY in our department right let me talk about it one by one also
nope your department should be okay huh
because
well let me tell you about my institute
because our institute is the best so many professors from other institutes put their hand in because he knows the students in our institute are the best
he also recruits students in our institute
for example there are many professors in DOUBLE E I transferred to DOUBLE E is because he came to our institute to recruit students
and institute of mechanical engineering as well I also talked to them
the one in the institute of mechanical engineering is even better he has the something heat
the high temperature plasma one for diamond thin film
ah
the top one in the United States holly the top one is academicians
really
he also goes dame
oh what do you learn about in the Department of Mechanics
about that diamond
no he is majoring in the aspects of high temperature plasma
ah
because our institute the institute of mechanical engineering in our university
ranks number eight in the GRADUATE SCHOOL in America
really
it is good to rank eighth yeah
but it also did a lot
ah
for your department you you learn about
how come there's a Department of Mechanics huh how come I didn't see there's one when I applied
yes
ME there is ME ME
ME we met one from Tsinghua your institute of civil engineering oh my a girl graduated in nineteen eighty's nineteen eighty six nineteen eighty's
followed this and now is freaking easy
my goodness please don't freak me out
ah
oh the numerous in common order
she
is it here huh
ah
class of nineteen eighty-eight
not the class of year eight damn it is earlier
nope that girl that girl is from class of nineteen eighty-eight
it is not the class of eighty eight it is earlier it is freaking six graduated in eighty six I guess
oh class of nineteen eighty-six um not
back then the Department of Public Affairs was really something
em em em
back then it's so awesome ah
I now fuck numerous at here fuck at here
no such Department of Public Affairs in my school
over there
here Tsinghua physics department countless fuck all are squeezed in electric engineering
university of Minnesota's electric engineering ranks number eighteen in America
oh
you mentioned this this many students from Tsinghua um are
physics department's
here for DOUBLE E huh
many fuck all there fuck I go into a lab
hey what's the ranking for your um DOUBLE E
number eighteen
eighteen
yes
ah
what about you
mine is the seventh this year is
yes your place is not bad in our place electric engineering used to be fucking good
I want to change to DOUBLE E later
glanced at my curriculum it's not ok
in our place electric engineering is right next to our department
but I want to transfer to that professor just want it very much I fuck in electric engineering that's the most fucking awesome professor the most powerful professor
um
he said I will send you to Wisconsin national lab to do experiments
um
then fuck
back then really wanted to transfer
then I I asked a few people fuck
electric engineering fuck you are transferring to electric engineering
what about electric engineering electric engineering is not necessarily better than chemical engineering in job hunting and getting higher annual salary I think that
er on the United States News ranks
chemical engineering and electric engineering
are about the same
um
and also once the economy is not is in depression electric engineering would be the first to suffer because electric first of all the industry
that chemical engineering is is about the products used daily nevertheless you will need
um
it won't be so cold
like like in the nineteen ninety-one
I I heard the teachers said
when they first came to DOUBLE E they all couldn't feed themselves they all didn't have a job
um
CHEMICAL ENGINEERING is specially good
um
CHEMICAL ENGINEERING won't be too bad
um
it's saying it won't be so bad because
it's daily necessities you
I this DOUBLE E did you know
the computers something like that
I economy depression I can reject it
um
this is just like this
so I just think again
its damn it DOUBLE E damn ranks the eighteenth fuck it
mine ranks the first here fuck it why would I jump to there for nothing fuck
um
I just stay here
right also if it's DOUBLE E you have many
have to take and also tutor the classes
relatively
also more painful
also the time is wasted
yes yes yes
do you know that er ROCKWELL this company
time is wasted
Rock Rockwell
um
never heard of it
in the California and then now it
it's recruiting it's recruiting that POLYMER COATING that is I am doing the PROJECT now
this year they came to that Meiji University for recruiting the is to DOUBLE E to recruit
I went to have a look
fuck need numerous recruit recruit need to recruit numerous POLYER COATING fuck
right now I realize that is
this is how it goes
this
realize it has more career opportunities
especially in some big cities or something like that this
or better school every year it has many this kind of
JOB that MEETING
job fairs
right all have this kind of INTERVIEW
there are many
fuck I
this is easy to look for a job it's relatively easy
I once I MS I can find a job definitely no problem fuck
there is no problem of MS also
but for MS your salary is kind of low
low annual salary
yes
the salary is kind of low only around thirty to forty thousand
even our department this year there is a
like us here
ah
person major in materials science
um
fucking studied doing the fucking
doing fracture mechanics analyzing the mechanical property of this film found a job the annual salary is sixty thousand fuck
really
her husband is in DOUBLE E fuck
well for industries like yours this material seems to be done relatively
relatively relatively kind of
just relatively relatively theoretical theoretical
theoretical you know
we at here
kind of theoretical
we at here
ah
we at here depends on how you do it we at here
most materials are for chemical engineering
chemical engineering materials
but once I listened it seemed that this kind of yours
is especially especially that is to say it's especially strong in theorization
no no no I I this I even I think this question is too fucking simple
ah
not advanced enough for doctoral dissertation fuck
all are too too PRACTICAL fuck
POLYMER COATING
oh
you you
you
well you that of yours is still PRACTICAL I will not it sounds pretty pretty damn mysterious
too that is it this organic dissolution of organic matter then those peptized peptized
ah
add the stuff like ceramic powder organic and inorganic powder into organic things to dissolve then
pour it onto that then spread it evenly then dry it slowly dry it dry it with heat and finished this is COATING
then you follow the reaction of this interface if it it could
to put it simply this COATING can
for example just like painting it's fine as long as it sticks
just like this then you take a look at the inside structure this is my PROJECT fuck just like painting fuck in the future
the metallic paint sprayed on cars fuck that would require POLYMER fuck
fuck
this kind of stuff can be used in anything even painting a wall need to use this stuff
so I think the range of application is wide
however
although this is very very very crude I still studied it fuck
very miserable
however for your situation I think if you want to graduate you still need to come up with some theories at least it should
ah what theory used used two pictures of electron microscope to deceive people
damn it's quite easy for me to come up with some theories
here I here I I've already had an article that pretty much can take on the shape
it can be published soon
do you know
the chairman of American Vacuum Society
ah
also wants me to be his student in our department
who is is
the chairman of American Vacuum Society
the chairman of the Vacuum Society
American vacuum society is very sick fuck
ah ah ah
a very huge society as famous as the physics society
um
um
in our department he was originally from the NATIONAL LAB in Wisconsin
oh vacuum vacuum that that too is useful just um your that too COATING is that what is it
yes
it has two kinds mine is not
it ionic huh ionic adsorption huh
but I'm not growing it in a vacuum mine is too simple his is MBE which is a layer by layer high vacuum
oh right you've told me back then you've told me
and then grow again
just there seems to be one such apparatus in Tsinghua right
MBE yes yes yes
ah MBE um
yes Tsinghua only has two fuck
there're two right
um
you told me that it seemed big and
ah he does it very well that guy does it very well what project is that guy working on working on semiconductor's ITCHING
ah
during semiconductor classes
ah
will be making devices like that
oh right your this is
your this your this material is
is close to physical meteorology huh
yeah yeah yeah yeah right right
is physical meteorology huh
but for physical meteorology I was told that it's it's comparatively boring
but very easy to get a job
right easy to get job offers but extremely boring
people say it's even more boring than the programming I'm doing
yes
ah
you write programs you are now are are making models
er what MODEL
that is making making simulations making making models right
alas right right right
fuck
yes
why did you choose this we this our department has numerous people working on models the modeling of chemical engineering no one wants to follow up on them
although modeling is very still could get a job chemical engineering
ah
nope what do you mean when you say MODELING
also
just to simulate a process just computer simulation
ah
are you working on something something similar
yes yes yes yes yes
simulated process right
ah right right right right right right right
fuck same as us fuck us at here us at here numerous people are working on it fuck
right is comparatively tiring this this thing is comparatively tiring
chemical engineering
just sit too damn long in front of a computer fuck just just working on a computer
right on I'm like this for the moment
then then looking for jobs fuck me
you can't even say you are doing this
it's quite easy for me to find a job
I took a look at this
you
nothing but you just say you did studied computer applications how is that in the future you will work work on computers
ah
you when looking for jobs do need to rely on computers when looking for jobs won't rely on your modeling to get a job
that's right now I'm just relying on computer to find a job
people from our place are not willing to learn MODELING damn it too too boring fuck
but it's quite boring damn it
there's no other way I have to be like this now
if you want me to find other teachers that is to say for this whole year of mine
I i think you were so lucky you you looked for TA and found this like
I probably have to do this
as for others they still found nothing
what what
so you've already found a boss others and I are still
this boss of mine is only temporary
oh it's temporary
yes definitely temporary I I this
next year I might wait and see I I I want to change
oh you don't have a a LONG TERM one for example the boss of PH D is still not found
no do you know that he he is eagerly to have me
uh-huh uh-huh
his opinion is to let me finish the three school years
um huh
but I think
it's quite hard to finish the three school years
yes
it must be quite hard because for many courses I've never learnt them before
yes
he this is actually it's the kind that
it's the kind the kind the kind that HAY TRANSTER plus THERMOFLUOROID DYNAMICS
um huh
um
uh-huh uh-huh
put together
my fluid dynamics is so damn hard to learn
ah right
here there is a academician from Academy of Engineering in my our fluid dynamics faculty he makes the final check I
today I I I'm not today for the FLUOROID MECHANIC I selected this this semester I can't understand it at all during the class damn it
it's so damn hard
after class I read the notes frantically
I took one week before the exam exam and damn then I got
it it is heard that you always get the first place
ah the first place
oh so does our place that teacher of China Society from our place told us that
I came first in four courses my goodness first in my class
you're so awesome I didn't I didn't got the first place but we got A for everything damn it
but I estimate that it must get the first place for physics because for the solid-state physics during that time I
really
ah ah
ah
found that all the answers I made were correct after the official answers had announced after the exam
ah
if he hadn't been picky I would have got full credit
I got full mark for three courses
and for the one one left there're extra points I should give the correct answers as well
and there's one course called FLUOROID MECHANICS I got ninety seven points
just short of three points to make a full mark gee just a minor error
you are so you are quite awesome
you are awesome
our place doesn't our place is always like this the POLICY of the exam in our place University of Minnesota Twin Cities
ah
the exam POLICY in our institute
ah
no
if you want to take courses in our institute you
cannot complete it
first of all the highest score you can have because it has one hundred and five points and you could only get no more than eight points
seventy one seventy two is the highest score
really
and the average is among thirty to forty
ah
and you can get a A is you get sixty and above we are very strict on A giving
that is
ah
we have very little A here
I think it's easy to get A here in our school
I am muddling along here then I should get A to be frank with you
ah
here we
just cramming prior to the exam will get me A
here we have A B C D shit
this teacher categorize in A B C D
we have A B here in our school
most of them are A B
fuck
graduates in other school get A B A B here we have A B normally A other institutes have A B C
ah
the A B C D here is freaking frightening
any D
yeah we have D we have D here shit you get a D even you have seventy five points
would there be any
he just said there must be D huh
yeah he damn him according to that he
impossible huh one can learn so damn well in this my goodness if one is to learn
according to the
according to the distribution and everyone needs to fight for it if you rank in the top you get an A shit
oh that's it
at this time Chinese people are freaking awesome Tsinghua four people from Tsinghua
all get an A wow
shit the Americas damn them if they are all stupid
ah here we are like this too
here we are like this too
just Chinese students are brilliant Taiwanese students sometimes are not that good
Taiwan is very
just all students from China Mainland are god-damned good almost all all of them get A
all get A
shit we when we completed the exam when we finished it the highest one is seventy one or what
more than ninety points
and I did not complete it fuck I saw the mark was fifty three point five shit I was like a damn fool
I could only get a B based on the score
um
and then
and I saw it had five questions
and I added the points from all five questions and compared to the total one how come there was ten points difference between them it calculated it added ten freaking wrong points to me
how come this is possible damned this is way out of line this
it turned out that I got sixty I I I was really worried
I that is freaking unbearable I kept telling I said sixty three point five and the teacher checked it yeah it is more than that he
bang I got an A
is it possible that someone is chased out to be B
yeah yeah yeah right then this made the sixty to the Bs
really
you Luo Ren
but I don't care or I am going to be the B shit
no still fifty five points
but for A B like this in your school there's no big difference I think
shit here we
what does it matter in your school you've got your mentor what's the matter then
yeah if we get our tutor done he will not CARE
fuck
gee
you especially you this seeking seeking good jobs this this is not quick
actually when you look for jobs your ACADEMIC RECORD may simply get ignored
um huh
it mainly depends on the INTERVIEW your this
yes
which is whether you have all what they need from you
as long as the requirement is met then it's settled
shit I my tutor is the one from Cambridge that tutor
is very strict to me
no no mandarin speaking anytime
speaking English he told me you need to you need to speak English
in the future you
you will make PRESENTATION you need to you need to get a job you need to stay in America to work and live he is very straightforward
you need to find a job if you have to live in the United States
you must speak English
you can't speak Chinese
you can't even speak Chinese with your Chinese friends
gee my goodness that is way out of line
fuck
this is absolutely there's one guy in our school just
just quit speaking Chinese ever since my goodness
never got him to speak again regardless of any seduction
well not necessary huh
it's too much
this after one one one one semester he's no longer that good
he doesn't allow me to
he doesn't he doesn't allow me to be with Chinese it's fine that I am with Chinese but I have to speak English
my goodness how could this be
fuck that
this god-damned should be raised
lodge a protest huh my goodness
I he said he said I don't he said he's not discriminating Chinese he said he he thought because I am in the United States I have to speak English he's an English he
this is a kind of discrimination
to in America speak should speak must speak English not necessary must be like that that is not to speak a single word of Chinese
damn it he thought he is the best in the world damn he graduated from Cambridge fucking believe he's the best
fuck then this is not right this this this is outrageous
already looked down on Chinese in the beginning fuck him fuck it
this is not right
so I I am
I am the first Chinese of his team
the first Chinese fuck it
really then screw the fuck out of you
fuck it so I damn it's tough but he
but he is a fine person anyway that is
he just he because he I guess he had encountered this situation in Cornell before he had recruited Chinese students in Cornell before
speak Chinese between Chinese and then he just always believes you two
doing something behind his back
fuck
he believes everything has to be public
for example he's in the group he put everyone
oh me
yes
he linked everyone's EMAIL together
um
and then what you send to me or vice versa everyone would be able to see it
um
if there's anything of anyone they would inform each other he thinks this is a very good atmosphere
he doesn't want a few people group together to do something
ah ah ah
because of the language
ah
Luo Ren is it time up Luo Ren
is it here
I don't know
he should have a hint
then it doesn't matter
anyway doesn't matter I'm on a public phone actually I also directly call this call call you
um um
my place a public phone
you
how are you are you busy with anything
of course busy fuck I'm in the LAB now
I don't I I WINTER have a look of the LAB this year fuck to see how do they make COATING fuck
really
ah
my place is just a workstation then write programs well nothing else
then recently I I'm working on that NETSCAPE
I know NETSCAPE we also making it here
yes I I might might at the time after after a month might have a HOMEPAGE
HOMEPAGE is just our this
HOMEPAGE you can build it yourself right
yes has built in on my own you you
I we can build it here but I
there's teaching lesson on how to build it for free here but I I didn't go to listen to it
huh this is
pretty easy
it's easy to learn anyway just read the book and that's it read that MANUAL and then will know
anyway complicated quite complicated the process is rather complicated
um huh
your University of Pennsylvania how how is University of Pennsylvania is it very
is the school very beautiful
the school is very beautiful
it's huge is it
huh not particularly big
with that one
how many people are there in University of Pennsylvania
how many people are there in University of Pennsylvania
this one
at least around twenty thousands
should be at least at least around twenty thousands
too little too little fuck the university of Minnesota too fucking big
really
just
twin cities yes exactly this fuck
fucking has forty fifty thousand damn it
forty to fifty thousands people
forty to fifty thousand
I don't really know about it
I don't know about this anyway I think the University of Pennsylvania is huge enough University of Pennsylvania because it's also a
he said it's in
university also a specially huge university
he's like this because it it the University of Minnesota how should I put it it says in America aren't there many universities which are not big universities
among the branch campuses of big universities in one city this one the University of Minnesota is the biggest have the biggest number of people
oh
and then I think those people in the fucking law school are all fucking crazy damn it
law school
ah I we we
law school how do you
here our place the law school is very good not bad
really
at our place here there is just one river a river the Mississippi River
ah
um
we are on the east bank the law school is on the west bank the law school fuck and others fuck
ah
ah
ah
those those people damn them
my tutor is that Minnesota one
graduated from BASE ENGINEERGING
oh he Minnesota's Aerospace and er Physics
in one is one department
right right right he graduated from this one exactly
yes yes yes graduated here that's fine that's fine
he he this he engages in that kind of Aerodynamics
do you know
aha
he graduated from this and then engaged in that CFD that is that kind of calculation
um huh
ah
then maybe you
if you work on the fluid
here we there's in our department an engineering academician who's doing fluid
fuck then I won't be with him he my tutor is quite brilliant he is the first-line successor of the originator
SKIP
oh
he is doing CFD the first-line successor fuck it just teach him alone
aha
ah huh
now his funding is damn a lot specially
um huh
FUNDING er
no I I said perhaps you come here to do a PROJECT with our department
ah
yes we now I now am with your department together we're joining efforts in doing this
it's our department
ah no no your department well the department of yours well your the AERIAL SPACE
our school
aha aha Department of Physics
er ENGINEERING
yes yes
then Department of Physics well the Department of Physics is no good
yes exactly with them no no not the Physics Department but the AERIAL SPACE ENGINEERING
oh oh our department yes our school has a Department of Aeronautics yes
eh with with that well MECHANIC ENGINEERING I don't remember it clearly
em yes yes yes
well that will do several schools joining together to make a foundation a they're doing it one by one
yes anyway this project is rather big
that's good Luo Ren you well your MINEAPOLIS is very beautiful fuck
really
very beautiful fuck
is it beautiful
well of course fuck
Philadelphia in my opinion it's indeed quite good especially this heh

it's just the U of Minnesota
maybe this neighborhood of mine belongs to the black men's district
fuck
do you know
too terrible
right here the proportion between the white and black people should be
er more or less three to eight I guess
in other places like NORTH that NORTH
ah
are the whites too few
no no no
between white and black should be eight to three
fuck eh well you guys there have too many blacks we here have very few blacks we here don't have many blacks either
right right it's more pure in your side here we have more mixed ones
we have lots of Catholics fuck

I â€™ll find, find, find a piece of paper later.
Okay.
What? Did you apply for a garbage card?

This one is $18.99.
Is it also for four people?
Uh, he did nâ€™t tell me clearly. [unknown] It seems that this one should be one to four people.
That person just came back from a conference in uh, Miami Beach.
Oh, it â€™s called Miami Beach.
Oh, do you not know this place?
I do nâ€™t â€™ know. I fucking at have nâ€™t gone anywhere. I do nâ€™t usually read the map either.
Miami Beach is next to uh, Miami.
They are two places.
I do nâ€™t know if they are going to Miami or not. I â€™m not sure.
Go ahead, others.
And then,% er, they [unknown] he said that uh Miami Beach is only 20 minutes away from the beach.
Uh-huh.
And then, it â€™s 1 - 800 - 468,
1 - 800,
468,
468,
1688.
1688.
Uh-huh.
What is it called?
% er, [unknown] S A N J U A N.
Say it.
Holy shit What ignorance, is it?
[laugh] How much?
[laugh] $26.
$26.
[unknown] oh.
I did nâ€™t say that you â€™re ignorant.
[laugh] I said that this name is ignorant.
Fine.
And then, 1 - 800 - 327,
327,
0553.
0553.
Yes.
B E, that place is called B E
B E L,
A I R E,
A I R E, OK.
This place is from $27 to $30.
They are all very cheap.
% er, the earlier one was $26, ah. The one before.
Fine.
What?
The one before was $26, ah.
Was nâ€™t it $27 to $30?
No , the S A N one above.
Oh, I know. I know, I know.
Uh-huh.
Is there any others?
There is one more that is not 800. Do you want to write it down?
Um, I â€™m not going to write it down .
Then you
I, anyhow, I wo nâ€™t call. It does nâ€™t matter even if I write it down.
That â€™s about it. This is the price for all of them. I think the entire area is this price.
Is that right?
Ah, right.
Fine, then I wo nâ€™t need it.
They said that, uh, in fact, if you drive there, ah,
Uh-huh.
I do nâ€™t know uh, uh, how it will be like at Christmas. He said that during this kind of time,
Uh-huh.
If you drive there, there is that type of motel all along your way.
Uh-huh.
And you do nâ€™t need to book it in advance. They said that the one they booked in advance was even freaking cheaper, [unknown] more expensive than the one they uh, went look for it directly.
Really?
Ah.
However, there may be many people who go play during Christmas.
Well.
That we do nâ€™t know.
However, if you can book one for maybe $30 or $40 now, it â€™s [unknown] still inexpensive, ah.
It does nâ€™t matter either.
It â€™s cheap. It â€™s inexpensive.
Yes.
Uh-huh.
On average, It â€™s only a few damn dollars for each person.
Right.
It â€™s pretty good.
Now you â€™ve decided to just, just, just go to one place?
% oh, it should be.
It should be. It should be,
Fuck, shit, it â€™s too much money. Where do I, I find the money now? Now, I.
No, he said that 600 or 700 is to plan for extra. When the time comes, [unknown] you may save 100, $100 and what not.
Uh-huh.
But I reckon it wo nâ€™t come down to 500.
Because even if you plan for extra, it still wo nâ€™t exaggerat so much, right?
Uh-huh.
I did nâ€™t calculate it. Other people did
But when I look at the hotel charge, shit, if it â€™s $30 for a day,
It only costs a few dollars per person.
Right, that â€™s right. The hotel is very cheap.
$5 to $6.
When you go there, at the uh, you [cough]
The admission is expensive.
The admission alone costs over 100.
The admission, uh Disney may, may cost 150 per person if you want to play, play all of them.
Exactly. You, you, the admission alone costs over 100.
Yes.
And then other things, we are [unknown] calculating it according to us here.
Based on us renting a car here to go there, [unknown] the fare also costs nearly $100 per person.
Oh.
Therefore, [unknown] it â€™s a lot. If you, you do nâ€™t rent a car, then, then,
Right.
Right.
It â€™s much better.
Yes.
Therefore, it is unlikely.
Yes. [breath]
Look, anyhow, have fun if you want to.
I, I, I, I, I, now other than letting them, there
Oh, we â€™ve probably booked two rooms at the Disney place.
Oh.
Seven of us will stay this way.
Uh-huh.
Then, for other places, I, now, he, he said that if you do nâ€™t go, then [unknown] he will only book one.
At that time, whether I, I go with you or with them, in any case, one is still enough.
Oh, oh, oh.
That â€™s all right. Then, do nâ€™t book it for me first.
Uh-huh.
Sure.
Uh [unknown] what day was it?
Yesterday.
Yes.
We drove to the coast yesterday.
Did you drive?
It was nâ€™t me who drove. I [unknown] I was afraid to drive.
Fuck , damn, I just started learning.
Oh.
You drove to the coast. How was it? Was it a lot of fun?
Oh, and [unknown] [unknown] the scenery was quite good but we bought about 15 pounds of crabs back to cook. { [laugh] }
{ [laugh] } How much did a pound cost?
% er
[unknown] Oh, a little bit more than a dollar.
[cough] It was darn expensive. [cough]
Expensive? You â€™re bullshitting.
Oh, it was very cheap.
[mouthnoise] It was very cheap.
% er, exactly. It was very cheap.
It was very cheap. Really .
Oh.
Oh, eating crabs can make one full. This is the first time I find out.
Oh, nonsense fuck, oh
One can be full by eating crabs alone. [breath]
Oh, did you buy them?
It was nâ€™t me who bought them.
We always eat them here.
Do you always eat them there?
[unknown] [cough] We do nâ€™t always eat them either. We ate them sometimes a while ago.
If they had it for sale, then we would =buy some to eat. It seemed.
Are yours sea crabs or river crabs?
$1.6.
They â€™re sea crabs, ah. Between $1.6 to $2 a pound.
Oh.
Shit. You have sea crabs there.
They â€™re very expensive.
Yes, we do. Why not? We have everything that you want to eat.
As long as you have money.
Yes.
Really.
At that time, we mooched off from them and ate a few times. Later, later, we stopped eating them anymore.
It â€™s mainly because I â€™m by myself. I â€™m darn lazy to buy, uh, and cook and what not.
Yes.
You have to go line up early in the morning at 6:00 or 7:00 to buy them.
Yes.
Is it a Chinese store?
% er, it â€™s not a Chinese store either. Who knows what â€™s going on.
Shit, are there any Americans who get up at [unknown] 6:00 or 7:00?
They do nâ€™t get up. It â€™s the Chinese who buy them, ah. It â€™s an American store that sells them.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
They must be making money, ah.
Yes.
There are Chinese store that also sell them but they are more expensive than this.
Uh-huh.
And they are smaller than those and what not.
Uh-huh.
So be it.
Shit, this is what is good about your place, ah. You drove, how long did it take you to go to the coast, ah?
An hour and 10 minutes.
[breath] Fuck. That â€™s too comfortable.
[laugh] [mouthnoise] Gulf of Mexico.
You can go to the coast and have fun when you have nothing to do.
Ah.
But the beach is not good. There is no beach.
No beach.
Um, there is also a place to fish. [cough]
What is that, that?
You need a license to fish, right?
[unknown] there is nâ€™t.
Shit, you still need a license to fish. [laugh]
That â€™s fucking nonsense. Fishing, in the United States, fishing, hunting wild ducks and hunting deer,
Uh-huh.
And crabbing and what not, they all need license.
Oh.
What do you think?
You â€™re pretty awesome [unknown]
Ah.
Shit, we also have Chinese who go fishing here . I did nâ€™t hear them say that they have to apply for a license.
It depends on where you go fish. Suppose they fish in secret, no one knows.
Generally, they all need a license.
Uh-huh.
You need a license for hunting and what not.
Do they need to throw the fish that they catch back, too? [laugh]
Yes, of course.
You have to throw them back if the ones you catch are not big enough.
Uh-huh.
Like the crabs you eat, [unknown] if the ones they catch are not big enough, then you have to release them back.
Uh-huh.
And if you do nâ€™t release them back and get caught,
Well.
Then, you â€™ll be in trouble.
Oh, how civilized.
It â€™s also too fucking [laugh] fucking civilized.
[breath] Too civilized.
[laugh] This [breath]
Wow.
Oh, for 30 minutes, you, can you not call China?
Um I ca nâ€™t. It â€™s long distance within the United States.
Oh.
Uh-huh.
It â€™s not too bad. How come I do nâ€™t have these 30 minutes? I can also call you for 30 minutes.
[laugh] That â€™s fine. I â€™ll uh, I â€™ll fill out an email some time and send it to you.
Sure.
Uh-huh.
I â€™ll then fill it out and send it again.
% er, right, you can also give it to your classmates again.
I, I â€™ll call again.
That â€™s fine.
You can also earn US $10.
Shit, fuck.
How come it â€™s so darn blessed, ah?
[laugh] Oh.
Okay. Then do it for me as soon as possible.
No problem.
[breath] It â€™s a pity that you ca nâ€™t call China.
Um, yes. It â€™s too unfortunate.
Hey, how â€™s your wife doing now?
She â€™s coming on the 10th.
The 10th.
Yes.
You figured it out.
I figured it out.
She â€™s going [unknown] directly to your airport there.
Right.
How many times does she have to [unknown] change?
It â€™s the same as when I came. [unknown] [unknown] one flight, Chicago.
Oh.
Atlanta.
[breath] Oh, how come the one you, you booked was so cheap, only $700?
It was less than 700. It was 650, roughly.
It was less than 700?
A total of 650. It â€™s good season [unknown] now, ah.
Fuck.
They even said uh
[unknown] There was also the cheapest one that cost less than $500.
I did nâ€™t believe it.
Um, it â€™s unlikely.
It was all in May when we came.
I had actually heard about 650 before.
When our, our classmate booked it
At that time, he
He booked it for his wife. His wife was
She came here in August or September.
Uh-huh.
The person gave him an offer. It started with 670.
Uh-huh.
It was also China Eastern Airlines. He did nâ€™t do it later. It seemed that the price went up.
[breath] It went up to over 700.
Oh.
[breath] It became your, uh, similar price as yours, as yours.
Uh-huh.
It â€™s such a misfortune. Did you, you book it with a Chinese agent or somewhere else?
You also booked it yourself.
There is a Chinese, [unknown] I guess, anyhow, it is a travel agency run by an American Chinese.
What agency is it called , called?
Let me, me see.
It â€™s called some Sun Coast.
The one in Florida called
Oh, [unknown] I â€™m not sure.
You do nâ€™t know?
That â€™s very cheap. I, shit.
Uh, I asked uh, Liufu.
Uh-huh.
Liufu â€™s seemed to be 640, 645.
Then it may be because it â€™s off season now, fuck.
Yes.
It â€™s good season.
Uh-huh.
[breath] Oh, fuck me.
This place was in fact 630.
Oh.
It added $6 for uh, the express mail service postage.
And then it added uh, [unknown] he said that it also needed, needed 6 percent for China Eastern.
Commission?
What was it called?
How would I know?
I, I did nâ€™t know. Anyhow, he asked for 6 percent of the money.
Mm - hmm.
The total came out to over 650.
That â€™s still good.
It was very cheap. Fuck me, it â€™s cheap.
Yes.
Fuck, when I came, I fucking spent 900, 950, shit.
That
960.
Who asked you to buy the American one. Shit.
I did nâ€™t know.
Um, right, at that time, it was also [unknown]
You did nâ€™t know at that time. You did nâ€™t have anybody here either. It would work if there were someone to help.
Yes.
Spent so much more money for nothing, you say.
Yes.
That â€™s fine. Anyhow, you came already.
Yes.
As long as you can take root here, $300 is still easy. [laugh]
What do you mean by $300?
I am just saying.
I, I, I
If you can actually stay here, [unknown]
What money? It does nâ€™t matter, right?
Earn it slowly, slowly.
I â€™m, I â€™m worried, ah. What shall we do when she comes? She â€™ll have to stay and be idle for at least over a year.
Why?
She still ca nâ€™t study yet, ah.
Did nâ€™t =she take the exam already?
She still has to apply, ah.
That â€™s fine. Work, ah. Idiot, Fuck. Why do nâ€™t you let her work and make money?
Where would she go work?
Go to your,
Do nâ€™t bullshit me. Does your [unknown] town not have any Chinese restaurants and what not?
Shit. It â€™s very tiring to [unknown] work in Chinese restaurants.
Fuck. You â€™re earning your tuition even if it â€™s tiring.
Besides, even if you â€™re not earning tuition, even after she comes and she has, has scholarship when she studies, studies in the future,
Money is still money.
Being idle is still being idle, really, you.
When she gets tired of being idle, idle, idle, do nâ€™t let, let her make you,
Is nâ€™t it?
Uh-huh.
Create gossips.
You, you, It â€™s okay to work, ah. [unknown] it â€™s not good for someone to have nothing to do either.
Besides, who does nâ€™t feel comfortable about [unknown] making money. Think about it, ah.
Now, you, if you have 1,200 a month, when she comes
I assume the expenses wo nâ€™t increase, increase by a lot.
Uh-huh.
It wo nâ€™t make too much of a difference.
You â€™ll buy an extra insurance at the most.
Yes.
In this case
You â€™ll still save so much money. If she goes to work and can earn 1,000 a month, you â€™ll save 10,000 in a year.
It â€™s not bad either.
The people who came here, if they did nâ€™t study first, they would all work.
What happen if they fucking catch you?
They can catch all they want. They ca nâ€™t catch a damn thing. Your, your, your, your, uh wife has no status.
Right.
Since she has no status, she does nâ€™t need to, they ca nâ€™t catch her. =She is F two. They ca nâ€™t catch her.
It â€™s not like you. You work for the school.
What can they do after they catch you?
Um, um.
Stop working at the most.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
They ca nâ€™t kick you back either.
Besides, no one is going to catch you. I think that no one is going to catch you. Do you have any precedent there?
No, I have nâ€™t heard of any.
Exactly. You have people there who work, right?
Yes.
That concludes it.
Yes. [breath]
Make some money, lad.
Uh-huh.
Money is a good thing.
We â€™ll talk about this later. We â€™ll talk about it when she comes.
She still needs to study.
You have nâ€™t %pw,
You have nâ€™t told her about such hardships, have you?
No.
Get a preventive inoculation. So she can be mentally prepared for it a bit as well.
Two people live,
Hey, You take your time to study. One person can finish school and find a job first. the other person, [breath]
Then support the other person to take the time to study.
Uh-huh.
Or, you two study together
Uh, there will always be a little problem with the money, the finance.
Yes.
Why did your voice turn coarse now?
I do nâ€™t know why. I might have caught a cold earlier.
You have matured.
[mouthnoise] Probably.
You found out, did nâ€™t you?
What?
You â€™re stifled without a wife. [laugh]
[laugh] You grew matured from being stifled. [laugh]
Uh-huh.
Yes.
How big is it actually over there? You said that it is a small town, small town.
Um, let â€™s see, we drive
We will be out of it if we drive for 20 minutes.
Is nâ€™t it too small?
It â€™s okay.
It â€™s okay?
It does nâ€™t matter, right.
It â€™s alright.
Us here, shit
Damn, we do nâ€™t even have a decent uh, highway here.
It â€™s alright. You â€™ll have it if you drive outside.
There is nâ€™t any decent one even if I drive outside.
I heard that the highways in Florida are very good.
Right.
There has to be. It â€™s impossible to have none.
Only %pw, Orlando is okay.
The highway like ours is ragged.
The interstate ones may be better.
However
The ones [unknown] around this town
Are all ragged.
Oh.
It â€™s been many years and they do nâ€™t have the money to repair them ah .
Missouri is not very rich.
[unknown] what, what?
That our state is not very rich.
Is nâ€™t there an industrial area?
% eh
I â€™m not sure.
It â€™s not an industrial area.
Wrong, wrong.
It â€™s not?
It â€™s not very developed.
We have a McDonnell here.
McDonnell is here.
Oh.
Uh-huh.
And uh, Busch is here.
What does Busch do?
You, you see the beer commercial every day.
Oh, got it.
It â€™s beer.
Got it.
Busch headquarters =is here.
Oh.
These two big guys may be richer.
The remaining ones are little guys.
Uh-huh.
[mouthnoise] When is your exam?
In 20 days.
20 more days.
Around December 10.
Do you plan on coming here after the exam?
Right.
what can you do?
Uh-huh.
I found that now I, fucking
I am very lost. Fuck, I do nâ€™t know what to do.
[laugh] Are you starting to feel lost again?
You are starting to feel lost again, [unknown]
I felt very lost in China also.
I did nâ€™t know what to do.
I did nâ€™t feel lost when I was in China. Every day was very substantial for me. Shit, I rode the bike for a few hours a day.
[unknown] You are bullshitting. You fucking played mahjong every day, fuck.
Do nâ€™t talk about it. I had only played it for half a year. I had only played for half a year when I did nâ€™t have a job.
Shit, half a year is not short, fuck.
I did nâ€™t play it every day either.
I did nâ€™t have a job then. I had to take exams.
Uh, Qian Tao, shit, he ca nâ€™t forget it.
I fucking worked later. I have nâ€™t, have nâ€™t played much afterwards.
Think about it. I went over to Tiananmen to fucking work. Shit, it was so far.
Yes.
I was half dead from riding the bike. Where did I find the energy to play mahjong at night?
Ah, Qian Tao keeps talking about you.
Really?
He said that he had never lost to anyone except you. [laugh]
[laugh] He should come over if he ca nâ€™t stop talking about me. [breath] We â€™ll play again if he comes, comes.
He, he seems to be in the army.
It seems that he is assigned to uh, some kind of unit of the People â€™s Liberation Army.
He must be sick, ah. Why does nâ€™t he come out?
He said how could he come out? [unknown] he did nâ€™t make it for the application to go overseas.
%pw, shit, he even asked me to pay for the application fee for a, a school. [unknown] did it not work out?
Oh.
Ah.
Hang in there, fuck [unknown]
He does that fucking thing. %pw, it should be easy for him to come out.
No,
Right, his score did nâ€™t make it.
Oh.
He engages in uh, nuclear physics and what not [unknown]
There is a fucking huge shortage of people here.
Right, right, right, very few, very few people, people here engage in this.
Well, %pw, work harder. He is not a fucking idiot. Think about it. He was admitted to Peking University for fucking postgraduate studies. He was too capable %pw, fuck.
Yes, right.
I fucking dared not apply for Peking University.
[laugh] He I think that his type of people, I am saying from that type of dump,
It was not easy to get admitted.
Exactly. You are saying work harder.
It â€™s just English, fuck.
Oh cough , uh, however, [unknown] , he is also getting old. His child is also so big already.
Really.
Think about it now.
Oh, he went home, did nâ€™t he?
No.
It seems that he is in uh, [unknown] Changping.
He is in Changping. He is assigned to Changping?
Yes.
Did he bring his wife over?
His wife wo nâ€™t go. His wife â€™s business is booming.
Shit.
Not going . What does she go to Changping for? [laugh] Shit
[laugh] % er, exactly. Ah, I ca nâ€™t think clearly.
[laugh] Shit.
That is too fucking deep. Shit.
Ah [laugh]
I do nâ€™t know. I do nâ€™t understand.
[breath] Having a family has the difficulties of having a family.
Fuck.

That thing, is it always that in =Netscape, you,
Once you key in the =source,
All the =source code will come out?
Uh-huh.
So you follow that to fucking write it.
Right, right. There is a type of language.
Allegedly, it is easy to learn if you have other concepts already.

Hi, Chen Yifang
Hi [unknown]
Are you still asleep? [breath]
No. I did n't sleep well last night, and I've just finished eating breakfast, and I said I will go back to bed for a while.
What happened with that phone call you spoke of yesterday -- I still do n't understand it.
[breath] No -- I, I've already,% er, pressed that to agree to, um, %pw, because [breath]
It's only one minute long, I mean,% er, where it discusses with you [unknown] whether they can record it, so, as I think I mentioned to you last night, I do n't think it matters, just talking randomly. [breath]
What it means is that it's for, um, a university in Pennsylvania
-- to be used in their research on the spoken language.
Oh.
There are many languages, um, such as %pw, Chinese, the Chinese language, Korean, Vietnamese, and so on,
Japanese, Farsi, French, and whatever. [unknown]
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Quite a few, [breath] so in any case, that is, if you do n't want to talk, then you just do n't talk. [breath]
Oh, oh, oh.
So,% er, did n't Chen [unknown] call you? I thought the minute was nearly up, so I simply pressed it.
Right.
Oh, oh, oh. No. [breath] Xie Jianye asked me yesterday what it was, and I said I could n't make out what it was either.
Hmm,
the thing is
I've not, not, not, not heard it explained clearly, because I was in a hurry yesterday,
[breath] the thing is there is a university, yes, it's the University of Pennsylvania, it's not our university.
Uh-huh.
It wants to do, um, some research on the spoken language, a survey or something.
Oh, oh, oh.
And then they'll give you thirty minutes free of charge to [unknown] the phone and speak your mother tongue.
Oh, oh.
And then,% er
well, I just, I think I will just use it and be done with it. [breath]
Oh, oh. You were talking about something like agree or not agree, and I'm wondering what there is to agree to, and I think what things are involved, so it does n't matter.
[unknown] =they will listen to it, =they will
[unknown] you mean, listen to our recordings, right?
Yes.
And then, as a result [unknown] the language research and whatever.
Oh.
Oh, oh.
=They will record that.
Oh, really?
Hmm.
Oh.
How are you guys? Last time, I, I, um,% er [unknown] found the phone number of that Yao Lixin's, he's actually over there in your place as well, right?
Yes, right, right.
[mouthnoise] Xie Jianye
% er actually saw him last week.
Really?
He, hey, he, it seems that he
has begotten a daughter.
Really?
I think so, probably [breath]
It has been several months already [breath] Two months or three months, I'm not even that sure.
Yes, Dixiao, that time Dixiao was, should say, you guy have got it really fast, [breath] he said it was fast he said that he was busy looking for a girlfriend at the time, and now [unknown] he even has a child.
Right.
Yes, when he had just, had just arrived, he even told me that he did n't have a wife, and then
Oh, you, you mean when he had just arrived in Florida [unknown]
Yes.
Really?
Gosh! He also said a while later,
[unknown] [unknown] too [unknown] Xie Jianye saw him in a Chinese store.
Oh,
because he does not live in our area.
Hmm.
[breath] A different beach.
Oh,
Because is n't it a beach where we are? For instance, beach this or beach that, and he's staying somewhere else.
A beach is just a,% er, um, that sort of place, that is
the same as a residential area
Right, it's not, [breath] because are n't we living along the seaside?
Hmm.
It just goes along the seaside from the north to the south, one beach after another, all the way to Miami.
[unknown] Oh.
And then he said he was still there, hey, later told him, [breath] , that he %pw, he had a wife now Xie Jianye said,
Oh, his wife arrived and said she was apparently in the former school in the north.
Oh.
And then
After a little while longer, we met him and he said his wife was pregnant.
And then, after some time, we met him again and he said that the baby was born.
Xie Jianye said how this could be -- he said
Really quick! [laugh]
Oh, yes!
So,% er, how are you?
I'm fine, roughly speaking, I have another five weeks, roughly.
Really?
Yes, I'm still holding on. I just feel dead tired and totally vexed!
It'll go really quickly too.
Oh.
Yes.
I have to go to work, and have to [unknown] [unknown]
I really feel
really dead tired, that is.
So,% er, you did n't get any major symptom, right?
Oh, more or less OK.
Oh.
We IBM are going to move to IBM, you know,
Yes. I heard from, um, that is, Yao Lixin told, um, Dixiao.
Right.
I keep meaning to ask you,
so when are you guys leaving?
Hmm. [breath]
We're probably leaving in February.
Oh.
Right.
So, you're leaving after the birth?
Yes, I'm leaving after the birth, some people are even leaving in January.
Hmm.
It , and then I told him, I said, it would n't be OK for me, ah, I said that I, um, was just about to have a baby, and he later said it would be in February.
So
The latest batch would probably be before March 1st, anyway, that is, [breath]
Oh,
we will all have moved over in February %pw, before the end of February.
Oh, the whole company is relocating just like that?
Yes, half of them are relocating
Eight hundred people, I think.
Why is this happening? So why are n't they simply building a branch office there [unknown] ? [breath] I think relocating like that might cost more money, right?
% Hmm
He thinks he will save money, because he [breath] , after he's closed its own =site,
Hmm.
he will
he will save on some expenditure every year, and he has plenty of the Austin =sites over there,
plenty of those
buildings are empty.
Oh.
So he just consolidates them, because IBM used to be very large, and now it seems
it's getting smaller and smaller probably because it has reduced its expenditure.
Oh.
And then he will [breath]
probably save some money over there. [breath]
Yes, he will probably save some money too, and it seems he, he has worked it out, and he said he could save a lot of money.
Oh.
He's worked it out somehow , I do n't even know how those budget of theirs are worked out.
Really? I think, I think that place is actually really great.
It seems they have worked it out
Austin?
I, I've been there, and my cousin is over there.
Really?
Oh.
Oh.
So,% er, do you want her phone number? If you, in case something happens.

So they are more or less settle really well. With that kind of job, there is no worry to be% er, settle, ah, whatever.
Right?
Uh-huh.
Yes, [unknown] income is probably not too high, but the benefits are very good.
Really?
Yes, it's very stable, that is.
I know it's in Round Rock, because we've been there, and we went to [unknown] , we [unknown] been to Round Rock already.
Really?
Yes. In any case it, IBM, rented an airplane every [breath] , it,
asked the family members, anyway, each family to go and have a look to see whether they like it, and whether your family is willing to go or whatever.
Oh.
Oh.
Probably a month ago, we, probably close to two months ago, I
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh. [breath]
took a trip there.
Oh, do you think it's good over there?
Hmm, it's OK.
Really? Last time I went, it left me with a really great impression, but I just thought that place was a little too hot.
Really?
Oh, but this city,
In any case, in any case, I , I came over from Houston, and I think it and [breath]
Houston are actually more or less the same.
About the same
Oh.
Right.
I think in terms of % er size it seems a little smaller than Houston, but still quite good.
Right.
A lot smaller big
Oh.
It's not very big [unknown] it's now developing quite terrifically, because it, for instance, 3 m, ah, [breath]
Hmm.

Her, um,% er, that's it% er, her husband is called Zhang Yue,
A "bow" radical and chang, making zhang, and yue is the yue in sanshanwuyue, the Yue in Yue Fei.

Oh.
She and her eldest are also very closely spaced, I think, the eldest child and the second child, right?
Yes, her eldest child,% uh, she said, has his birthday on Halloween, and just turned one.

Yes.
She is
It seems she is a month behind you, I think.
Oh.
One, two, February [unknown]
Really?
I'm not sure. [laugh]
[breath] She, um, %pw, she, um, is Wu Xia still running that computer store or something at the moment?
No, because she, she
She's not running it for now because of those two children, and she said she will first move to a new location, which she's not that familiar with.
Oh,
She, she, originally her father came just to help her do it.
help her look after her child, probably.
[unknown] Right. He was helping her do it, at first, after the store was up and running, and later on, probably, he, at first, it seems,
I do n't know; I have n't asked her about it in that detail. [breath] It seems he is
looking after her child at home [unknown] , both looking after the child and probably giving her a hand or whatever,
Right.
and then, later on she found a partner,
Uh-huh,
and then, um, um,
that is, their family people lived together to do it.
Oh.
And then she left, and that partnenr just carried on managing that store as partnenr.
Oh, really?
Uh-huh.
She, she,
In any case, it's quite a pity that she left, but
Yes, that store of hers was run, it seems, [breath] , it seems I heard Wu Xia say it seemed quite
Hmm,
like quite good.
Right,
After that, she came over here where we are for a visit,
and Dixiao took them for a tour of that computer store.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
She said, hey, those things are sold for a much higher price than us, she said.
Right?
Oh, she said [breath]
% er, some of the things, things I'm selling are even cheaper than Walmart, she said.
But she, I do n't know what the market is like in that current city of hers.
But she %pw, she knows %pw, the market is definitely good if it is in this city of ours, because there is a university.
Uh-huh.
[cough] Who knows with them?
Oh.
In any case, she, she is not thinking about that for now. She will just have her baby first and then see how it goes.
Right, this time , with the two children, she will just [breath]
just have to put it off. I'm now having my second one, and even I think it's really troublesome, and I do n't even know how to deal with it. [breath] His mother will arrive on the 16th of next month.
Oh, really?
Yes.
The old lady will be happy, now she has a grandson to hug.
In fact, she had one the last time too, but she may feel different about it.
She [breath]
Did n't that little , did n't [unknown] younger brother have a son last time, have a grandson?
Right, she, um, [breath] because she, over there, there was a, um, she, um, %pw, she has an old lady over there to look after him.
Right.
She may feel like she ca n't get to play a role, probably.
She, in fact, I do n't know, she.
Oh?
I think she may have a feeling of being unable to play a role.
Right, that's why she now [breath]
may, may feel happy. I do n't know, she, and in any case I did n't get to see her. [breath]
Hmm,
Hmm, there is a little chance.
Anyway, when she comes, there are some things to do. Well, you also saw her last time, did n't you?
Oh, yes, I saw her.
She was terribly anxious herself, with nothing to do there.
Oh.
I do n't know whether now she has something to do she will
feel a little better?
I think she will feel a little better, and besides she will , if she has been retired, retired for a [unknown] time, she will be emotionally calm too.
[mouthnoise] Right.
You see, back then, had n't she just retired?
Yes, probably
Yes, just retired, [unknown]
Terribly anxious.
She really did n't know what she should do.
Hmm.
So, [breath] we, [breath] last time I went to, um, [breath]
ah, Austin, and then [breath]
oh, gosh, how come I had a little bleeding after we were run off our feet for a couple of days?
Really?
Yes, and later I just rushed to [breath] the emergency room and stay there.
You in, um, Austin?
Yes, we had a big fuss of it and later he said,
Really?
said that placenta of mine, that is, something called [unknown] [breath]
Hmm,
[unknown] called the placenta.
Oh.
that is to say, it was a bit [breath]
downward, in other words, it was a little, um, what do you call it? I mean placenta =previa.
Oh, oh.
So that caused a little
%pw, I mean, bleeding, ah, or whatever. The doctor insisted I stay in hospital. [breath]
Uh-huh.
So far, I'm probably
I do n't know, that doctor said [breath]
Hmm.
I have taken a look, and if you're blocked too severely, this child will probably have to be delivered by Caesarean section, probably.
Oh, really?
Yes, and afterwards I asked him, I said, what caused it and so on, [breath]
Hmm.
He asked me some questions, and he said, it was probably because you have had too many abortions.
Oh.
Ah, too many abortions, and the, uh,
child is, uh, [breath]
lying on the placenta in, um,
a position that is not ideal.
Hmm.
He said it will affect his development and so on.
Oh.
So, oh, I do n't know either, probably,
Really?
Yes, in any case, if there's a problem,
I do n't think there'll be a problem.
If there's a problem, in the end, I will probably have to [breath]
Well, for a normal Caesarean birth, you have to do it two weeks early.
Yes, he will take a look, he, I will probably wait another two weeks.
I heard.
Hmm.
He's going to do another full =examination, to see whether the position of the, um, [breath] placenta is blocked,
Hmm.
or whether it is OK,
and if it is not OK, then [breath]
he will definitely have to
Hmm,
do the operation, he, if it is [breath]
only blocked a bit, or the position is more or less OK, and could actually be fine [breath]
for the childbirth, he, that is
Hmm.
I will be allowed to have natural birth and see how it goes.
Oh, and if it's not OK, then do that something. Oh,
Sometimes I think
Yes, if it's not OK, then do that.
Oh.
Oh gosh, it could even get to that, what a mess! [breath]
[breath] Um, what's her name, um,% er, my, my, um, cousin in Canada
gave birth to two, twin daughters in the first birth,
Uh-huh,
And the second, the second time, was,% er, the second pregnancy was roughly just a year apart, no, the second birth was roughly a little bit over a year apart, thirteen, or fourteen months, I think.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And it turned out that the second time
it was not quite, not quite full term yet when suddenly she had a massive hemorrhage and so on,
and was rushed to hospital for a Caesarean birth.
Right, and she also was, I think it was also a case of placenta previa.
And in the end, she
in the end she gave birth to a baby of just, just a bit over four =pounds.
Really?
Morever, she did n't even stay in hospital and had no special care before returning home. [breath]
She [unknown] said her third child was now more or less as big as her% er, her eldest child and her second child.
She said it was probably because she did n't breastfeed her eldest child and her second child, whereas she did breastfeed her third child.
Really?
Yes, she did
No, one of her births was a twin and one was a single child, and they are probably different , and it'll be because the nutrition of the twins [breath] needs to be divided between two.
Yes, [unknown]
Oh,
Right?
Who knows how she could look after three daughters by herself, by herself.
That is just I heard you say last time that she, she said she was pregnant again, I did n't know then
And they're all of a similar age.
and %pw, it seems she did n't say she had given birth to any
Oh, she was probably also, also a little, [breath] they also explained, said that one was, that is to say, if you
give birth at too close an interval,
Hmm
it would also cause this, this, placenta previa, because you have just, the uterus has just,
Hmm.
has n't fully recovered yet.
Right -- it has n't fully recovered yet, and she, um [breath]
Right
That's why people say that after having a child you should, um, wait until some six months or one year is up before getting pregnant again, in addition also , after having a D & C, you should wait for a year or six months, [breath]
Right, right.
That's exactly what he meant, he said he was worried that it, um,
Right.
[unknown] because the uterus has been damaged.
Right.
Because when it was impregnated, it
it just needed to find a
place that it felt would be the most secure.
Oh.
If it felt those places, if it felt they were all insecure, it would find a place, find a,
just shift to another position.
Right.
He said that would have an effect, he said.
Right.
The doctor told me
by both gesticulating and explaining it by means of pictures, and at first I did n't even know what he was talking about. [breath] I only knew some individual cases, such as me,
Who knows when it comes to medical matters?
Oh.
And it was only afterwards that I understood, later on he again
Right.
When I got back here, he phoned his younger brother again, and is n't his younger brother studying this? Gosh, only then did he
Right, right.
fully understand what exactly it was [breath]
Oh.
what was going on. [laugh]
[unknown] Is Chengcheng happy at the moment?
She's OK. At first, she was not that happy.
Really?
Oh.
She actually felt like how come [unknown] there was another one, and after a little while it seemed she would
also just,
She just called you in that loud voice.
Right,
I do n't think it's even like her.
I told her, I said I'm,
Hmm
with, um, [breath]
with your dad in the garage,
Hmm.
And then she's there upstairs,
reading books or whatever.
Oh.
She thought I was downstairs,
Oh.
so she called out at the top of her voice, and in fact I'm just in the room next to her. [breath]
Oh.
I'm upstairs, my master bedroom is upstairs, and I did n't hear her call out. I could n't make out if she was shouting to the master bedroom or the master bedroom â€“ I could n't hear clearly anyway.
Oh.
Oh.
Later she pounded up the stairs again, and I thought it was probably my phone call.
Oh. [breath]
She
It seems her eyeglasses, eyes have now still [breath]
been getting further nearsighted.
Really?
Yes. Originally it was four hundred, and now it's more than five hundred, nearly six hundred.
Oh.
So she generally always wears eyeglasses?
Right. [breath]
Oh.
And I do n't know what's happening to her. Even if I am worried, it is not of any use. [breath]
In that case, would a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine or whatever have a way of treating it?
She has been to see one
[unknown] She's been, when she went back this summer, she had both acupuncture and massage therapy.
And it did n't work either?
That's right,
It did n't work, and then the doctor once again suggested [breath] that that eye was connected with some spleen or stomach, and she needed to have some dietetic regulation.
That's true,% uh, yes, I think it definitely is connected with the body.
[breath] Yes, we also [breath] did dietetic regulation for her, [breath] and also
It seems I remember there seemed to be a period of time in China when people spoke about eating sheep's liver or whatever, %pw,
Yes, they talked about eating sheep's liver, carrots, and other things,
% hmm it means,
it was also suggested we not upset her.
I said, who would upset her? [breath]
He said we should make her happy and whatever,
Hmm.
Gosh, I said,
So she is -- does read books and things too much, read too many books. [unknown]
Yes, I think she definitely does,
She spends too much time playing on the computer.
as a result of reading books and whatever,
So,
I do n't know. Wait and see how she goes, if it gets worse in future, and then she will just have to
Hmm.
wear contac lenses or eventually have a surgery or whatever.
Oh. [breath]
Well, Zheng Hongmin also said, he said
he did n't even wear glasses when in school, and after he started work, he now wears glasses
Zheng Hongmin?
That's right. He, he said it was precisely due to excessive use of the computer.
Yes. I also think that's probably what it is.
Oh, it's a complete mess. Her eyes, I now even, that is, she is fine with everything else, she is =pretty good in all aspects.
Hmm
I'm just worried, as she is now just one meter fifty.
Really?
Yes.
So she is probably a little taller than Ang'ang, and Ang'ang is now one meter forty - something, it seems.
Is that so?
Well, I measured him at one meter forty just a few months back, and I think he must be taller [unknown] now, is n't Ang'ang
stout?
Really?
Hmm.
Well, at eighty - nine pounds, according to him, [breath] , um, he weighed eighty - nine pounds several weeks ago, I think.
Oh, uh-huh,% er
Right?
Oh.
Well, Chengcheng is
eighty - three pounds, or eighty - four pounds, hey, Chengcheng is now also
Really?
Oh,
stout, and also seems very well - built. I think she seems to be about to go into puberty or whatever.
Really?
Right, apparently, um,
That's probably about the time.
she can =really eat a lot as well, and, what's more, the, um,
Oh.
the, um, what's it called?
Hmm.
um,
her butt sticks up, it seems.
Oh
Xie Jianye has always said,
hey, your daughter's butt sticks up, saying there seems to be some kind of problem [unknown] .
[laugh] I said, what problem could there be?
She said [laugh] , she said whether
the fact that her butt sticks up so high means her front will become arched.
I said I do n't know. [laugh]
There's going to be a curve. [laugh]
So, right.
Oh, her butt is now really raised, and
Oh, well, that must be more or less right. In America, all children would probably develop a bit earlier, and I think Ang'ang will probably also develop soon.
Right.
Right.
Hmm.
I do n't really know, she, I said, he said, anyway, seems to be now =quite
also =quite heavy, I used to always think she was thin and skinny .
Oh.
She also, also seems a bit heavier now.
Oh.
Xiaoming,
Xie Jianye is there
Oh
Xie Jianye , um,
Hmm.
is downstairs,
doing some work.
Is he?
Yes, um, we
have been to a store,
What?
there was a, I mean there was a store, ah, that closed down two days ago.
Oh
Oh .
After it closed down, uh, it had a bed that was used as, um,
a sample, a baby's bed,
Oh.
which was on sale
Oh, oh.
And I actually bought it and brought it back while it was on sale. I bought it and brought it back because it was one of those things on sale, where there are just some parts where the paint is not very good.
Oh.
Oh.
% Uh, Xie Jianye is painting it in the garage. I was actually just helping him there.
Oh.
And then I was helping him do it, and for a while after that, I just, hey, I said, I'll lie down for a while, as I'm feeling a little sleepy.
Oh.
Oh.
So I ran upstairs.
[breath] Oh. [breath]
I'm now just buying these things, because I do n't, do n't actually want to go and buy new ones, you know, because it's just this one now.
Oh
Oh.
Right.
You would have to spend quite a bit of money if you went to buy a new one.
Right.
I do n't actually know right now.
What's more, you also have to move home.
Right. I think
Some things
That's true
Oh, moving home is actually all right. In any case, when it comes to moving home, =they will come and do the moving, and =they will come and do the packing.
Oh, oh.
=They will do all the packing and all the moving, and after moving there, you can move wherever you want to move, and if you're unwilling to move, =they will give you, um,
storage free for three months.
Oh, [breath] no -- I think things over there are probably cheaper than in Florida.
Really?
Oh, I, I have that impression.
The taxes are high over there.
Are they?
Oh, um, a quarter,
Really? I do n't know how much the taxes are.
The tax is 8.25, and many people make their purchases over here.
Really?
Yes, and after buying them, they get IBM to move them there.
Oh, that's probably just because the taxes are high, goods -- but at the time I, I felt that goods prices seemed more or less OK, and in addition it seemed that food was.
Its foods are cheap.
Yes, it seems that foods to be eaten do n't have, do n't have,
do n't have any tax.
There is no tax on food products.
You guys are too noisy, go away quickly.
Um,
% er, OK, then. Dixiao went to St. Louis yesterday evening,
Really?
for a meeting.
Oh,
He's just come back from his first one.
Over there where you are is that Ang'ang speaking?
Yes, they are both here, I said, you go away, making noise here.
So, is, um, your Yangyang now attending
Not yet, I have n't sent him there.
daycare?
Um,% hmm because this period is a busy period for me,% er I'm afraid that if we send him to the kindergarten, he will constantly catch a cold,
Uh-huh.
constantly fall ill, and in the end% hmm
that old lady can still look after him, she can look after him until the end of this year, and so I do n't want to send him there until January next year.
By that time, I wo n't be actually that busy, and if he's going to fall ill, he might as well just fall ill.
Oh.
Uh-huh.
At the moment, I do n't %pw, I do n't want to let him get too whatever.
Really?
Hmm. Because if he is sent to the kindergarten, he will definitely start off by
getting every illness once.
Right.
Oh.
That's what it's like, =Linda over here where we are, that is, it suddenly became cold over the past, past two days, over seventy %pw, around seventy degrees, [breath]
Oh.
Hmm.
Everyone said they had got colds.
Really?
Everyone, all
Yes.
Um, Linda also [unknown] at, Chengcheng is also having a cold.
Oh.
[breath] What a mess.
I just asked Chengcheng, I said, do you still remember Ang'ang? She said she does remember him.
Right.
[breath] So, when Wu Xia and the others came that time, they actually said,
said that the pair of them had once played together, uh, and so on.
[unknown] Right,
So Chengcheng was over there,
looking at that
that photo, you know, does n't she have one with, [breath] Chengcheng
Uh-huh.
and
Ang'ang hugging like this? [unknown]
Oh, oh.
She used to always keep it in that photo album of hers.
Uh-huh.
And later she moved it to the back.
Really?
You thought she
was a little child, did n't you? She's grown up now, when she gets her little friends to come and see her, [breath]
Yes, [unknown] would like to come over to play.
Oh.
see her photos, they all ask, who is this? Your boyfriend?
She actually
She% er, no no no no no, it's no no no no no, she was asked on two occasions, and I once suddenly discovered it. Hey, I said, Chengcheng,
Hmm.
Why did you put this photograph at the, um, back? On top
Hmm.
of the photographs -- ca n't you double them up ?
Oh, ah.
Hey, she said, people are always asking me, said, they ask so much about it that I ca n't really explain it properly, [laugh]
Later on, I said
I said, what are you afraid of? I said, she was still little then.
Oh.
She said, no, Mommy, she, no, Mommy, she said, she said, it's enough for me to know, she said, so that people wo n't ask questions in a way that becomes really tiresome for me.
She, she actually, actually, really minds about it.
Oh. [laugh]
Yes, kids nowadays probably all ask about that, as soon as they see it, they say, oh, what is your relationship to this person? What are you doing here?
Right.
They will definitely ask about it.
Yes, on that day did n't Weiss Wu Yugen have a son?
Hmm.
He often came over to play as well, and later they went to New York.
Hmm.
He actually came over.
Oh.
% Er went out for some fun, people all said, hey, Linda,
and said, who is this guy? She said
um, she just explained that this is her cousin.
Oh, really? [laugh]
Yes.
She did n't explain it, [breath]
and then I said, why are you saying this?
She said that if she does n't say this, other people will gossip.
So, um, so, that boy, that boy could also, also understand what she said, uh, that boy must have laughed too.
Yes, that boy knows. They know as well.
Really?
Oh.
They also know why she, you, you explain it like that, she said the two, the boy, um, the boy, for whatever reason, also, also just agreed to say this.
[breath] How old is that boy?
Two years older than her.
Oh, so he's not very old either.
Right.
Oh, [breath] he, um,% er
They're now in New Jersey,
Right.
um, said, yes, he is, um, hmm, called [unknown]
% er, um, the branch [unknown] , branch
what's it called, [unknown]
Vice President
Oh, is he?
% Er
He's a VP? I do n't think so. In any case , they [breath]
That kind, that kind, this kind of companies like JP Morgan, it, that kind,
Hmm
%pw% er
this kind, this kind of rank,
Hmm.
% hmm
is not very, that is, there are many of those [unknown] VP, you know.
It has many, um, branch, that is to say, a [unknown]
Not a branch, it, that is to say, its, um,
its, um, name is just called, for example, [breath]
Hmm.
if we were in China, it would be called [breath]
for example,
be called an engineer, and then a senior engineer, and so on.
Oh, so that's how it goes,
It, that is to say,
it goes up by one leap, it is just that, [breath]
Oh, oh.
just
% er, that is, it's just a rank like this, which, when you say it, sounds very impressive, it is just all called [unknown] [breath]
Exactly
Oh, oh.
Right.
all called VP, such - and - such a VP at such - and - such a rank , but
Oh, oh.
% er, he said, um, um, in this sort of company, we originally also thought, he said he, in that company of his, he said,
Hmm.
there are probably altogether just
The lowest rank seems, I do n't know what it is called, and then, the one below it, and then the third, third rank is called a VP.
Hmm.
Oh.
And then he said, said that five out of ten of them there are probably all, um, VP. [laugh]
Oh. [breath]
[laugh] He just [breath]
just belongs to that kind, that is to say,
Hmm.
it's something like, like a job title.
Oh, oh.
At first we also thought, wow, I said good [unknown]
quite something [unknown] ,
something like an official, he said it was n't actually like that at all, he said, [breath]
Ah, ah.
Oh, hmm.
he said that over there there were a large number of VP â€“ - that's what he said. [breath]
He said there were so many that you could easily run into a bunch of them [unknown]
% Er, the, um, [breath]
That day , um,% er, that is, in that place where Little Huang, that is, Little Song, Hengchang's wife is -- they're in Philadelphia,
Yes,
and called us my [unknown]
Yes.
Uh-huh.
In areas [unknown] around us, it seems there are quite a few [unknown] [unknown] .
Right.
[breath] Um,% er, did you know that, um, Meng Huan has also got married?
Yes, Meng Huan has found some kind of, someone in the Shenzhen TV station,
No, it's not Shenzhen, it's Hainan TV station.
Oh, Hainan TV station, right, right, right. [breath]
Right. [breath]
Yes.
% Er, so,
And then, [unknown]
Hmm. Besides, this one and -- Lin Tao's sister also knows this person.
Really?
It seems that Lin Tao's sister is also an anchor in some TV station.
Really?
Yes, then, does n't Lin Tao also know Little Huang and the others quite well? [breath]
Yes.
In the end, um, probably, %pw, um,% er
% er, when Lin Tao's sister happened to go over to where Lin Tao is,
Hmm.
and said, I have a friend who came to visit me, and it turned out that when this friend came, they found -- oh, they used to know each other, and she actually brought Meng Huan with her.
[laugh] Really?
[laugh] Really funny!
Oh, gosh! The earth really is quite small.
Oh, [unknown]
[breath] Having been all over the places, they actually end up bumping into each other! I heard, um, Old Bao talking about it that day.
Oh.
Old Bao was saying,
Hmm.
he said that Meng Huan had found a, oh, I just got it wrong when I said Shenzhen -- it's something in the Hainan TV station. [breath]
Hmm.
Oh.
And then Old Bao even said that Master Meng is really quite talented -- that's what he said. [breath]
Right, is n't his sister in the Shenzhen TV station?
Oh, his sister is, no wonder,
Meng Huan's sister.
Right, I meant [unknown] was probably
So, so his sister probably also helped him, gave him a hand, or whatever.
Oh.
So, so, but, he is, when that Zhao Zhongxiang led a group of people on a visit to America,
Uh-huh,
it seems that Meng Huan worked, uh, as a receptionist, uh, tour guide, uh, something like that.
Yes, it seems that he, Meng Huan, has been over there all along doing this sort of thing.
Yes, just something like that, he's currently in China.
Oh.
So he will often go back to China, and then [unknown]
probably,% hmm,
will come back in December, [unknown] we went there twice last year,
Last fall we went to New York twice and saw him both times,
and he was still by himself.
That was actually =pretty quick. [breath]
It really was quick.
he said that it seems that Qian Yi has found a Taiwanese one, apparently,
Right.
got married, and had a child, it seems,
Really?
Did he hear it from Old Bao?
I think Qian Yi probably had some contact with Old Bao and the others, I [unknown]
Yes, it seems she gave birth to a,
Hmm.
gave birth to a child, and was said to have apparently got, got, got fat.
Really?
Something like that, yes.
In a good mood probably
Yes.
And then Old Bao also said,
also said that -- who was it? --
he said [breath]
Hu Dan is apparently still =quite lonely on her own there at the moment. [breath]
Gosh! Hu Dan is really doing things in a wrong way He.
Right!
She really is.
She has spent such a long time there, stirring up trouble for no reason, stirring things up,
She really is.
She herself does n't know what position she's in, in this society.
Right, probably, she seems to, I think she seems to be =quite,
because she has a PhD, right?
Apparently, she thinks she is very
She must
She must think that she's really great, probably.
Well, you, right, the other person is also not [unknown] [unknown] not, very good, and so you ca n't always, say,
when you're meeting someone, you just just have a relationship with, with him, well, if that guy has a PhD, he must also consider you.
% Hmm, right, She definitely I ca n't actually, actually, actually work her out, and, in any case, I suppose that's her personal, personal life,
{breath ideas about life, in any case, she wants to go through the hassel.
Right.
Just let her go through the hassle over and again, and see what would happen to her after going through the hassle for a while.
I just could n't work her out.
That [breath]
That Wu Yugen called two days ago, and he said he [breath]
hmm, over Thanksgiving he is going to
DC, where [unknown] Ye Danying is.
Oh, right, right, I [unknown] I know that Ye Danying is over there.
